Trusted counselors of the court, advisors whisper words of guidance in the ears of those in power. Many nobles lean so heavily on their counsel that they make few decisions without them and insist on their attendance at all meetings and public events. Advisors are often master manipulators, and their guidance can shape a barony or even a kingdom-for good or ill.
