    desc: " (divine,prediction) A voidworm can anticipate the most likely presence of a creature through a supernatural insight into chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants it the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of [[Spells/Veil of Privacy|Veil of Privacy]] or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense."

    desc: " (divine) A protean's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the protean takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first. The protean is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]], the protean automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Protean Anatomy|Effect: Protean Anatomy]]"

A successful DC 19 Will check save negates this effect and grants temporary immunity to confounding lash for 1 minute."
