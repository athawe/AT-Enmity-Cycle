# Wayfinder, Esoteric `pf2:0`

### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Item\]**

**Prerequisites** Tier 2 with the Grand Archive; You own a [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]]

**Cost** 2 Fame

**Action** Free Action

* * *

**Effect** You have modified your [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] to focus your mental energy, driving more reliable insights. When you slot this boon, you apply its benefits to one [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] in your possession, granting you a special free action ability when the [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] is invested and in your possession.

You can activate this ability as a free action before you Recall Knowledge. If you roll a critical failure on the Recall Knowledge check, you instead get a failure.

You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a DC 10 Flat check. On a success, the [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] is broken. On a failure, the _wayfinder_ is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a [[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]] that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.
