Arboreal wardens are the rangers of arboreal society. These itinerant folk have an innate curiosity about the woodlands in which they dwell, and rarely stop to take root and rest in the same part of the forest twice. This wanderlust makes wardens ideal forest patrollers and scouts. While they are robust combatants, they know better than to confront dangerous foes on their own. Instead, they report any dangers to arboreal regents. In rare cases, large groups of arboreal wardens congregate to form a copse. Copses travel beyond the boundaries of a forest to investigate the hinterlands and gather intelligence on potential threats before returning to report their findings. Arboreal wardens do not pretend to understand to other creatures' motives-like most forces of the natural world, they are ambivalent about mortal affairs that do not involve their forest.

Arboreals are guardians of the forest and representatives of the trees. As long-lived as the woods they watch over, arboreals consider themselves parents and shepherds of trees rather than their gardeners. Consequently, while arboreals tend to be slow and methodical, they are terrifyingly swift when forced to fight in defense of the woods. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of short-lived folk-even elves are fugacious in the eyes of arboreals-and have an inherent distrust of change, arboreals have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long-winded, rambling monologues, especially if such pupils also express a desire to protect the timberlands. Against those who threaten their realm, such as loggers eager to harvest lumber or settlers aiming to establish croplands or a town, arboreals' wrath is unwavering and devastating. Perhaps ironically, arboreals are gifted at tearing down what others build-a trait that serves vengeful members of their kind well.
