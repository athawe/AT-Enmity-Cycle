# Alkenstar Agent Dedication
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Deception and at least one firearm
* * *
**Access** You have been initiated by the grand duchess of Alkenstar or one of her agents.

* * *

You put on the persona of a rough and tumble outlaw, but your real goals are to report threats to Alkenstar back to the grand duchess. You become an expert in Deception and trained in your choice of Underworld Lore or Legal Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You gain the [[Feats/Lie to Me|Lie To Me]] skill feat.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Alkenstar Agent|Alkenstar Agent]] archetype.
