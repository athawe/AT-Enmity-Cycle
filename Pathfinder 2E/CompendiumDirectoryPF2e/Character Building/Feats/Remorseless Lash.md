## Feat 1
### [[hobgoblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You're skilled at beating a foe when their morale is already breaking. When you succeed at a melee weapon Strike against a [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened]] foe, that foe can't reduce their frightened condition below 1 until the beginning of your next turn.
