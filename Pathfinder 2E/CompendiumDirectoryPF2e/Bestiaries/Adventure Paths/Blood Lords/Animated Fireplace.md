    desc: "  Like normal objects, the animated fireplace has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage the fireplace takes by 7. Once the animated fireplace is reduced to fewer than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks, removing the Hardness and reducing its Armor Class to 20."
