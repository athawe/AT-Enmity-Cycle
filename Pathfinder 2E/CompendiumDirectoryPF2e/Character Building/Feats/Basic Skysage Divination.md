The stars move, granting you a sliver of their magic. Choose a 1st-rank spell from any spell list to add to your spell repertoire. You can Cast this Spell as an occult Oatia skysage spell.

At 6th level, you gain a 2nd-rank spell, and at 8th level, you gain a 3rd-rank spell. Each of these spells must be from the divination school.
