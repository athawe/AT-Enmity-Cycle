Excessively zealous, a cultist finds exalted purpose in their sect. Never questioning their leader, they devote themselves to achieving their most perfect spiritual form.

Those initiated into the hidden truths and forbidden secrets of the world are forever transformed-or so they claim. To the cynical, a mystic is nothing more than a charlatan or zealot. Others profess to sense an aura around such luminaries and treat them with reverence, lest they offend some harbinger of unspeakable doom.
