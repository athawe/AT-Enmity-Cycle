Lingering Note EMPLOYER MERCHANT WORKSHOP 
**District** Lower District
A cluttered shop whose alchemical supplies are plentiful and varied but tend to be lower quality than those offered for sale at Pillbug’s Pantry. Nisk stays here to help out those who are less fortunate.
**Wares** alchemical items and supplies, potions (any time one purchases an alchemical item, roll a secret DC 2 flat check—on a failure, that item is faulty and has no significant effect when used) 
-  [[Salamander Elixir (Lesser)]] 12 gp
[[Nisk Tander]] (NG male half-elf alchemist 4; indifferent; *Perception DC 16, Will DC 15*) 
	Supported PCs can make a bit of money working for Nisk, and can Earn Income with Accounting Lore, Library Lore, or Mercantile Lore checks to help keep his store organized and efficient. 
	In addition to the money a PC earns from this job, as long as the PC achieved a success at Earning Income, the flat check for failures that applies to wares sold by Nisk is removed for the following 7 days. 
	Finally, after 3 weeks of downtime helping him out, his inventory expands and level goes up to compete with Pillbug's Pantry.
- He wants the organs from a [[CompendiumDirectoryPF2e/Bestiaries/Monster Core/Krooth|Krooth]]. They're worth up to 80 gp if properly harvested and preserved.
