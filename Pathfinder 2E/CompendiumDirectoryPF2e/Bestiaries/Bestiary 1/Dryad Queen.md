    desc: "  A nymph queen is intrinsically tied to a specific region, such as a forest for a dryad queen. As long as the queen is healthy, the environment is exceptionally resilient, allowing the nymph queen to automatically attempt to counteract spells and rituals such as [[Spells/Blight|Blight]] that would harm the environment, using her Spell DC with a counteract rank equal to the highest-level druid spell she can cast. When the nymph queen becomes physically or psychologically unhealthy, however, her warded region eventually becomes twisted or unhealthy as well. In that case, restoring the nymph queen swiftly heals the entire region."

Hamadryads rule over an entire forest, or a portion of an incredibly large forest, leading and protecting all dryads within. Hamadryads often have strange relationships with powerful and deadly fey, working together in a dualistic way despite their differences, with the hamadryad representing nature's wonders and the other fey representing nature's wrath.

Nymphs are a family of fey that take the form of beautiful humanoids with elven features and have a deep association with the natural world. The most common of their kind are the dryads, which are spirits that embody great trees, but many other kinds of nymphs exist, including naiads, who watch over bodies of water. All nymphs are guardians of some element of nature, typically a specific tree or pond, or even-in the case of nymph queens-whole forests or massive bodies of water
