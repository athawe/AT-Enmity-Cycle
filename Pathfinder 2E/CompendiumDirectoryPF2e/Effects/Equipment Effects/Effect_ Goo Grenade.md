# Effect: Goo Grenade
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Goo Grenade (Lesser)|Goo Grenade (Lesser)]], [[Equipment/Goo Grenade (Moderate)|Goo Grenade (Moderate)]], [[Equipment/Goo Grenade (Greater)|Goo Grenade (Greater)]], [[Equipment/Goo Grenade (Major)|Goo Grenade (Major)]]

When you hit a creature with a goo grenade, that creature takes persistent acid damage and a circumstance penalty to its Speeds from the clinging goo.

The target can end any penalties, conditions, and persistent damage caused by the bomb by Escaping or spending a total of 3 Interact actions to pry themselves free of the ooze. These Interact actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.
