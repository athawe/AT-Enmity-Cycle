    desc: "`pf2:2`  The ascendant beats their wings in a frenzied motion, creating a powerful blast of wind that disperses fog and gases and blows objects of light Bulk or less away. All creatures within 20 feet of the ascendant must succeed at a DC 24 Reflex check save or be pushed 5 feet away from the ascendant, or 10 feet on a critical failure. A flying creature that fails its save gets a critical failure instead."
