    desc: "  Whenever the troop Strides, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the troop enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop."

  - name: "Troop Spellcasting"
    desc: "  When the necromancer troop Casts a Spell, their constituent members combine their efforts into casting a more powerful version of the spell than any one member could achieve alone. When Casting a Spell that has an area of a burst, cone, or line and doesn't have a duration, increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a smaller radius isn't affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone or line that's normally 15 feet long or smaller, and add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line."
