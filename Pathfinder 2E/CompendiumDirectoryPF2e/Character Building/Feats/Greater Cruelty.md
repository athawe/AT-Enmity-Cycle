# Greater Cruelty
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Cruelty
* * *
The extent of the corruption within you does more than simply sap your foes' strength, it devastates their minds and reflexes.

When you use [[Feats/Cruelty|Cruelty]], choose whether you want to make the creature enfeebled as normal, to make it [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 1]] on a failed save (clumsy 2 on a critical failure), or to make it [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] on a failed save (stupefied 2 on a critical failure).
