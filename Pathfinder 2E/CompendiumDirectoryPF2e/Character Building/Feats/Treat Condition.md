# Treat Condition `pf2:2`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[healing]][[manipulate]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** Medic Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are holding healer's tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free.

* * *

You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], or [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened]] condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one.

Attempt a counteract check against the condition, using your Medicine modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC.

You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have Legendary Medic; even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10.

Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the enfeebled condition a good character gains from carrying an _unholy_ weapon) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.

* * *

**Critical Success** Reduce the condition value by 2.

**Success** Reduce the condition value by 1.

**Critical Failure** Increase the condition value by 1.
