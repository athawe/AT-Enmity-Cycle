    desc: " (aura,poison,radiation) 20 feet.\n\nAn abysium horror constantly emanates a powerful energy toxic to life. This radiation sheds dim light in the area. Any creature beginning its turn in the aura must attempt a DC 27 Fortitude check save, becoming [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]] on a failure or [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure. Once out of the aura, an affected creature's sickened condition automatically decreases by 1 at the beginning of each of its turns."
