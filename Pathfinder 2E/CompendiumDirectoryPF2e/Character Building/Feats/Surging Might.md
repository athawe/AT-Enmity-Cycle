# Surging Might `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[manipulate]][[oracle]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 




With a complex gesture, you focus the divine power of your spell to overcome enemies' resistances. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, the spell ignores an amount of the target's resistance equal to your level against all the following types of damage: chaotic, evil, good, lawful, negative, and positive.

This applies to all damage the spell deals, including persistent damage and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the vitality energy within a [[Spells/Field of Life|Field of Life]]. This doesn't cause the spell to ignore immunities, only resistances.
