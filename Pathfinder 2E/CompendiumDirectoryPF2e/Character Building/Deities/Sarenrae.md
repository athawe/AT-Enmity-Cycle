###

Once a powerful angel and empyreal lord, Sarenrae led the charge to imprison Rovagug. The Dawnflower seeks to redeem evil where possible, burn it away with the fire of the sun when it can't be redeemed, and restore those harmed by evil's machinations.

**Edicts** destroy the Spawn of Rovagug, protect allies, provide aid to the sick and wounded, seek and allow redemption

**Anathema** create undead, lie, deny a repentant creature an opportunity for redemption, fail to strike down evil
