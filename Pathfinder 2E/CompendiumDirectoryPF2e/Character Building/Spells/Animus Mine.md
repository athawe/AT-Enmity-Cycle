You can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to suppress the effects of the mine for 1 round to allow someone to safely use a mental effect on you. You can Dismiss the spell.\n\nThe first creature that uses a mental effect against you triggers the animus mine, causing the spell to end. The animus mine deals 4d8 mental damage to the triggering creature, which must attempt a Will save. This spell should only the deal the mental damage on magical mental effects that send their magic into your mind, not if a creature tries to do something mundane like talk to you.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes half damage.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 1]]. You are unaffected by the triggering mental effect.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 2d8."
