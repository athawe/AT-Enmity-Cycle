  - name: "Entropy Sense (Imprecise) 30 feet"
    desc: " (divine,prediction) An akizendri can anticipate the most likely location of a creature through their supernatural insight into the forces of chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants the Scholar the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of [[Spells/Veil of Privacy|Veil of Privacy]] or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense."

  - name: "Protean Anatomy 6"
    desc: " (divine,polymorph) An akizendri's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the Scholar takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first.\n\nThe Scholar is immune to polymorph effects unless they are a willing target. If [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]], the Scholar automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,polymorph) The Scholar takes on the appearance of any Small or smaller creature. This doesn't change its Speed or its attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but might change the damage type its Strikes deal.\n\n* * *\n"

    desc: " (divine,emotion,mental) A creature hit by the Scholar's bite Strike must attempt a DC 20 Will check save.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] for 1d4 rounds.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is also [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1 round."

  - name: "Text Immersion"
    desc: " (divine) When the Scholar casts [[Spells/Secret Page|Secret Page]], it can physically immerse itself in the text, changing the message of the text in the process. It can exit the book at any point by Dismissing _secret page_, at which point it appears in a space adjacent to the text. If it does so to begin combat, it rolls a Deception check for initiative.\n\nAs long as it remains immersed in the text, the Scholar has no body. It can communicate telepathically with a creature as long as the creature touches the book or scroll that contains the secret page. It can sense nearby creatures using its entropy sense, but not in any other way, nor can it use any attack, manipulate, or move actions or speak aloud. If the object they are immersed in is destroyed, the Scholar reappears in an adjacent square and is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 1]]."

  - name: "Text Passage"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (divine,teleportation) **Requirements** The Scholar is adjacent to a text they have modified with [[Spells/Secret Page|Secret Page]], and another such text is within 500 feet\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The Scholar has a way with words beyond other akizendris. They physically immerse themself into the adjacent text, which they use as a medium to teleport to another text within 500 feet that they have modified with _secret page_. Once they enter the first text, they instantly know the locations of the other texts within range.\n\nEntering a text in this manner automatically dispels the _secret page_ effect on it, but not the _secret page_ effect on the destination text. The locations of the Scholar's modified texts are marked on the map."

Akizendris gnaw at sources of knowledge and lore, gleefully corrupting and altering them to vex scholars and sages across the planes with contradictions and untruths. These proteans appear as cackling, serpentine creatures with elongated crocodilian faces, luminous eyes, and arms that vanish at the elbows into swirling clouds of runes before reforming into solid talons.

Akizendris amuse themselves by rearranging or deleting texts, placing insulting acrostics in poetic verses, and penning crude insults upon title pages. Libraries in such places as Heaven, Axis, and Hell are especially keen to avoid such contamination, knowing that their records are choice targets for every akizendri in existence.
