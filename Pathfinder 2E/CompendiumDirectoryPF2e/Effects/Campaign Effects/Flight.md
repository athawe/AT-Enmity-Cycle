### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[occult]]

**Category** deityboon; 




**Frequency** once per day

* * *

Unbound by the weight of flesh and bones, you become untouched by even the most basic of mortal experiencesâ€”gravity. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed or 30 feet, whichever is greater, for 10 minutes. While flying, you may grow more ghostly in appearance, or you might leave some sort of temporary flickering trail in the air while you travel as you see fit.
