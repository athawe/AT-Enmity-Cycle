# Effect: Brightness Seeker
## Level 9
### 






**Trigger** You attempt an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw while performing the course of action from your [[Spells/Augury|Augury]], but you haven't rolled yet.

* * *

**Effect** You gain a +1 status bonus to the triggering check, or a +2 status bonus if the result of the augury was woe and you proceeded anyway.
