As you use your magic to manipulate air or water, you divert some of its currents to form a barrier around you. If your next action is to [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] with the air or water trait, until the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC or a +2 circumstance bonus against ranged attacks. This effect has the air or water trait, or both, depending on the traits of the spell you cast. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saves against effects with the air trait, water trait, or both until the start of your next turn, depending on the spell's traits.
