Make a blend of reactive and proactive play. Sometimes, the world acts on the players, and sometimes, they chose what they want to do.
The next sun orchid festival is in two months. Zridi wants the Enmity Cycle to be performed in the leadup to the auction. This would cause the event to go awry, possibly wrecking the atmosphere of the auction and cursing many people. Then the whole ordeal would act as a 'super spreader', both to Thuvians and to tourists.

### Jeweled Sages
- The _**sage jewels**_, also known as _**sage stones**_, are [artifacts](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Artifact "Artifact") of [ancient Osirion](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ancient_Osirion "Ancient Osirion") used to pass down knowledge across millennia. These [magical](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Magic "Magic") [gemstones](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Gem "Gem"), which date to at least [-3000 AR](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/-3000_AR "-3000 AR"), have been passed down and rediscovered throughout their history. The [Jeweled Sages](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Jeweled_Sages "Jeweled Sages") are dedicated to locating and reuniting the _sage jewels_.
	- Known _sage jewels_, either intact or destroyed, include the amethyst, diamond, emerald, sapphire, topaz, onyx, spinel,[2](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sage_jewel#cite_note-salvation-of-the-sages-24-2) and ruby[3](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sage_jewel#cite_note-race-to-seeker-s-folly-18-3) _sage jewels_.
- The Jeweled Sages originally formed around [-3000 AR](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/-3000_AR "-3000 AR") to compile the nation's history and catalogue its treasures near the end of its first golden age. It persisted through millennia until scattering within a year of the [Keleshite](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kelesh "Kelesh") invasion in [1532 AR](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/1532_AR "1532 AR")
- Thousands of years later in the 48th century AR, [Amenopheus](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Amenopheus "Amenopheus") acquired the _sapphire sage_ stone and took on the title of Sapphire Sage. He resurrected the order and recruited new sages while pursuing and acquiring further _sage jewels_.
- Known members of the Jeweled Sages include:
	- Amenopheus, the Sapphire Sage
	- [Tahonikepsu](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Tahonikepsu "Tahonikepsu"), the Diamond Sage
	- Sinuhotep, the Amethyst Sage
	- Dhiara, the Topaz Sage
	- Mnesoset, the Spinel Sage
- There have been other Jeweled Sages in history as well, such as the [Ruby Sage](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Ruby_Sage&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ruby Sage (page does not exist)"), and _sage jewels_ that have changed hands repeatedly over the millennia.
- The _emerald sage jewel_ is rumored to be in the possession of [Grandmaster Torch](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Grandmaster_Torch "Grandmaster Torch"), though it is unknown if he is considered a member of the Jeweled Sages.

### Footprints of Rovagug
- In addition to humans and [dwarves](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Dwarves "Dwarves"), the region hosts scamps, [manticores](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Manticore "Manticore"), [criosphinxes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Criosphinx&action=edit&redlink=1 "Criosphinx (page does not exist)"), [hierarcosphinxes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Hierarcosphinx&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hierarcosphinx (page does not exist)"), [maftets](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Maftet "Maftet"), and [wyvrens](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Wyvren&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wyvren (page does not exist)"). [Behirs](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Behir "Behir") and [lamias](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lamia "Lamia") live among a number of the hot springs. The region is also infamous for its relatively large number of cults, including those of [Urgathoa](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Urgathoa "Urgathoa"), [Lamashtu](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lamashtu "Lamashtu"), and [Rovagug](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Rovagug "Rovagug"), which flourish in the wastes.

### Div Lore or Religion (Recall Knowledge)
Based on the result of a *DC 15 Religion check, a DC 13 Div Lore check*, or another appropriate *DC 13 Lore check to Recall Knowledge*, the PCs might know more information relevant to this adventure about divs and the Usij. Remember this check should be rolled secretly.
**Critical Success** Divs were once genies tasked with aiding mortals in acts of creation. Each div has an obsession from their prior existence, such as the skull-headed doru’s desire for arcane secrets and the aghash’s hatred of all beauty.
**Success** The Usij are cults of fiend-worshippers, dedicated to the foul divs and their fearsome lord, the living destruction known as Ahriman. Their goals always seek to ruin or undermine mortals.
**Critical Failure** Div and Usij favor bargains and deals, always abiding to the letter of the agreement
