    desc: "Sadness flows out of you into nearby creatures, blotting out any other thoughts they had. The first time a creature begins its turn in the area or enters the area, it must attempt a Will save. If it later leaves and reenters the area, it uses the same effect as before.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes a -1 status penalty to skill checks and Perception checks as long as it remains in the area.\n\n**Failure** While the creature is in the area, any emotion effects of lower counteract rank than _overflowing sorrow_ are suppressed, and whenever the creature attempts to use an emotion action or cast an emotion spell, it must succeed at a DC 11 Flat check or the action or spell is disrupted.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature cannot use emotion actions or spells.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** When you Cast the Spell, you can choose to increase the area by 5 feet."
