All creatures within the cloud are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside it are concealed to those inside. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind."

    desc: "`pf2:1` (fire,primal) The sootsoldiers reignite and rush across the battlefield, Forming Up and Striding twice. At the end of this movement, a wave of flame and heat pours off the sootsoldiers, dealing 4d8 fire damage to other creatures in a 10-foot emanation, with a DC 29 Reflex check save. A creature that critically fails its save is also knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]."

    desc: "  Sootsoldiers ignore the [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition from smoke."

  - name: "Troop Movement"
    desc: "  Whenever the sootsoldiers Stride, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20- foot area (minus any missing squares), then move up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any of the sootsoldiers' squares enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop."

Powerful deities and warlords strive for dominance over the Plane of Fire and the rest of the Inner Sphere in order to prove fire's supremacy. Armies of flaming soldiers go to war against each other on battlefields of smoke and smoldering char, all unable to bring their full power to bear. Ymeri, the vicious and victorious Queen of the Inferno, commands legions of sootsoldiers: elementals capable of battling the armies of her foes and, even when destroyed, rising from the ashes of the Eternal Furnace, scorched and triumphant.
