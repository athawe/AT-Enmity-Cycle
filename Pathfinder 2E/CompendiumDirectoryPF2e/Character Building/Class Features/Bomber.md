# Bomber
## Feat 1

**Category** classfeature; 




You specialize in explosions and other violent alchemical reactions. You start with the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical bombs, in addition to your other formulas.

Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of [[Class Features/Infused Reagents|Infused Reagents]] to create your signature items using [[Class Features/Advanced Alchemy|Advanced Alchemy]], you create three items instead of two.

When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, you can deal splash damage to only your primary target instead of the usual splash area.
