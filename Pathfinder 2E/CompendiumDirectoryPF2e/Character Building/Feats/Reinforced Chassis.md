# Reinforced Chassis
## Feat 1
### [[automaton]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your body is designed to be particularly resilient. Your chassis is medium armor in the plate armor group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of -2, a speed penalty of -5 feet, and a Strength value of 16. You can never wear other armor or remove your chassis; however, you still don't become [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] from sleeping. Finally, you can etch armor runes onto your chassis as normal.

**Enhancement** Your chassis becomes difficult to overcome. You gain the [[Actions/Chassis Deflection|Chassis Deflection]] reaction.
