# Improvised Pummel `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Weapon Improviser Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You are wielding an improvised weapon.

* * *

You make a Strike with your wielded improvised weapon. You gain a +1 item bonus to the attack roll, and the Strike deals two weapon damage dice if it would have dealt fewer.

If the attack is a critical hit, in addition to the effect of the critical hit, the improvised weapon breaks. If the item has a Hardness greater than your level, or if it's an artifact, cursed item, or other item that's difficult to break or destroy, the item doesn't break and the attack is a hit instead of a critical hit.

At 12th level, your item bonus to the attack roll increases to +2 instead of +1, and at 16th level, the Strike deals three weapon damage dice if it would have dealt fewer, instead of two.
