Brett Johnson says that the 3 things that must be inherent in a criminal for them to engage in crime are *willingness, ego, and knowledge*.

### Personal PC quests
- ?

### The Other Hand & The Lingering Note
- Yin and Yang morally grey organizations run by **Kylas and Deyad**. They are back by or influenced by Zridi from the shadows. (It's all smoke and mirrors)
	- Hearstona Patts, a whole plotline inspired by [Patty Hearst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbionese_Liberation_Army#Kidnapping_of_Patty_Hearst). She was kidnapped by the agents of Deyad's organization, before becoming one of them.
	- Within each organization there is the public face and the quiet dark elements are known only to those with clearance.
	- Art objects as loot, leading to clues that further the plot. (who the artist is or what the art portrays/does)

- Bounty Board missions for side content that ties back to main adventure
	- Bounty board mission for someone who is missing 
	- Bounty board mission for bringing someone to justice 
	- Escort mission to one of the Water Lord's domains 
	- Fetch quests for materials (flowers for dye, cactus milk for alchemy)
- Some people have been framed for crimes they didn't commit, and are being shipped up river to a hidden prison island in the Inner Sea. A group of their friends wants them freed, and the true culprit identified. The true culprit could be a puppet (knowing or unknowing) of Zridi. Ideas and inspiration - *Beyond Horizon -> Of Reefs and Ruin*, a 5th level adventure.
- The halfings refugees from Bripip's village are here, they are harboring a fugitive from the law, someone who has won the trust and respect of the community (who is the fugitive and what did they do). They've been in Lamasara for a few years. Partway through the campaign, a leveled up Bripip arrives to lead them home. 
- One of the nearby Water Lord Domains has been overtaken with lycanthropy. 
- Nobles are arriving for 
- Lord Yamthar, a power player in Absalom and Queen Zamere’s cousin is spear-heading the excavation of numerous tombs and ruins in the Thuvian desert. Most of these are in the territories of various Water Lords, but they aren't aware because the ancient sites are hidden, disguised or magically sealed.
- Queen Zamere is away negotiating in Aspenthar, and many of the stronger warriors around town (militia based force?) have been hired by merchants and tourists as guides and escorts (and are thus out of the picture). The time for crime is prime in Lamasara.
- Tempt the party with graveknight armour.
- A curse inflicts a random child every generation causing it to transform into an aberrant beast upon its 16th birthday. The source of this is the ghost of a young man who was in line to be pharaoh 1000s of years ago. An artifact that his spirit has bonded with has been used as a decoration for ages. Perhaps his sword is used as part of a decorative sundial.

Character ideas: 
- A wealthy merchant of great valuables - a young [[Fortune Dragon (Young, Spellcaster)|fortune dragon]] in disguise. Valuables tend to stick to him when he gets angry.
-  Upleveled [[Gnome Bard]] 
- A street 'magician' in the Market Square. 
- Shayliss/'Shroud' - advisor to Queen Zamere?. A vigilante at night, some kind of sorcerer. [[Vigilante Dedication]]
- "Raving Reporter" a presentation by an actor that tells the news in Alex Jones' style before a live audience. 
	- connected to criminals 
	- slides in [[Propaganda Promoter]] 
	- has some useful information, mixed with some false theories 
### Researching the Ruins to the south
- [ ] Make this about the ruins to the south of Lamasara, set up some foreshadowing of what can be found there, both in terms of loot and threats.
- [ ] Ruins of Akhenaten, on Thuvian side. 
	- [ ] Monsters: 
	- [ ] History: The remains of what was once a dwarven monastery. The Ouat dwarves that inhabited the area have most moved southeast or throughout Thuvia's city-states.
- [ ] Ruins of el-Amara, on Osirion side 
	- [ ] Monsters: 
		- [ ] **Herald of Disdain Karesh-Ekhial**, a General in Ahriman's forces. She's a Sepid div with 4 barbarian levels 
		- [ ] 14 [[Sepid]] divs
		- [ ] 5 [[Ghul]]
	- [ ]  History: El-Amara was once the provincial capital of Thuvia, when Thuvia was still part of the Ancient Osirion. It was abandoned and fell to ruin when pharaohs started to ignore their distant vassal state. It was in el-Amara that [High Theurgist Fentet-Pesu](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Fentet-Pesu "Fentet-Pesu"), the last Osirian governor of Thuvia, was assassinated in [-841 AR](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/-841_AR "-841 AR"). Since its fall, few had visited the half-buried spires and crumbling bell towers of el-Amara, until a few centuries ago when disciples of [Ahriman](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ahriman "Ahriman") took to the ruins to establish a base near Osirion. Currently el-Amara is populated by [sepid divs](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sepid "Sepid") led by general [Karesh-Ekhial](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Karesh-Ekhial "Karesh-Ekhial") and hordes of [ghul](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ghul "Ghul") thralls.
- Whoever has the backstory where they're close to the Runewatchers can get more prestige in the organization for completing this.
Simply asking around to Gather Information is an excellent way to learn more about the sites; each attempt to do so takes 2 hours of work. Alternatively, a PC can attempt to Recall Information about them on their own. Finally, Hakren Zost’s collection of lore likely holds additional secrets; these checks take 1 hour. 
#### THE Ruins RESEARCH TOPIC 4 
UNIQUE LINGUISTIC 
**Gathering Information** Many locals have their own stories and tall tales about the Ruins; **Maximum RP** 5 
**Research Checks** *DC 19 Diplomacy* 
**Recall Knowledge** Any PC with the right skills can attempt to remember information about the Ruins; **Maximum RP** 5 
**Research Checks** *DC 17 Lamasara Lore, DC 19 Society* 
**Consulting Hakren Zost** Hakren has a large collection of old books and tomes that contain bits and pieces of information about the Ruins, but unless the PCs earn his support, every time they attempt a Research check here, he’ll charge them 5 sp for his services; **Maximum RP** 5 
- [ ] Replace these with details about the dungeons
**Research Checks** *DC 19 Academia Lore or Library Lore, DC 21 Perception* 
	**1 Research Point** What are they and how far away  
	**4 Research Points** The safest route to the Ruins is X, Y, Z, head south; the rise up to Devil’s Platter is rough but climbable there. The Ruins itself is about a half-mile south of the climb. Locals mention that Hakren Zost likely knows more about the Ruins, and if he doesn’t, there’s surely more information among his collection of old books. 
	**6 Research Points** Dimensions and how old the ruins are. The latest group of adventurers to attempt to explore the Ruins included Alma Avertin’s daughter, Arika, but Arika claims they ran afoul of the ???. She was the only survivor. 
	**10 Research Points** There are several caves lining the Ruins' inner walls. A clan of ? dwells in the uppermost caverns.
**Reward**: Grant the PCs 10 XP for each tier of Research Points they reach, to a maximum of 50 XP if they reach 15 Research Points

### Looking for Arika Avertin
Once the PCs learn about Arika Avertin’s tragic adventure in the Ruins, they may try to seek her out for more information. With a successful *DC 15 Diplomacy check* to Gather Information, a PC confirms that she still lives in town, but she’s been away for a while with a new group of adventurers. A visit to Lamasara Savories (area 21 on Lamasara’s map) confirms that she’s not in town. Her mother, Alma, is worried about her, and if she trusts the PCs she might ask them to keep an eye out for her. Alma can confirm who Arika’s been adventuring with (see Dinner at the Rusty Dragon on page 35) but isn’t sure where she is now—last she heard, Arika and her new group had headed south to Magnimar. Alma’s had arguments with her daughter about her adventuring lifestyle, and worries that their last fight may have driven a rift between them that might not mend—if the PCs find her, she asks them to let her know that “Mother is worried about you and wants you to come home.
The PCs might also ask the Runewatchers, for this faction is known to keep track of local adventuring groups. The Runewatchers, a relatively new group in town of scholars who study all things Thuvian, can confirm that Arika’s previous adventuring group met a grisly end in the Ruins, but other than knowing that she recently headed to Magnimar to join a new adventuring group, they don’t have much more information about her whereabouts at this time. 

### The Clockwork Songbird 
Vorvashali Voon runs the Feathered Serpent, Lamasara’s only curio shop, and as such, he makes it a point to get to know adventurers—after all, their discoveries keep his shelves stocked! The first time the PCs return from the Ruins and are at least **5th** level, they find a message from Vorvashali waiting for them, inviting them to pay him a visit at his shop and offering a 5% discount on that visit. 
When the PCs visit, they find Vorvashali has prepared for their arrival with a delicious tray of baked goods and candies from Lamasara Savories. He closes the shop as they enter and invites them to have a seat at the least-cluttered table in the shop, and as he feeds them baked goods, he asks them to recount their latest adventures in the Ruins. 
At some point during the conversation, he produces a curious object—what appears to be the wingless, headless, legless body of a clockwork bird about the size of a blue jay. Vorvashali tells the PCs that an adventurer claimed to have found the part in a goblin’s den on Devil’s Platter, and he’s eager to find more parts of the bird if they’re out there. He asks the PCs to keep an eye out for parts that might fit this bird (he suspects there are five more parts—a pair of wings, the head, the tail, the feet, and the winding mechanism), and says that he’ll pay 50 gp for each songbird part they find and bring him. 
Unknown to Vorvashali, when completed, this clockwork songbird’s song can be used to open a vault door deep in the Ruins (see area H13). He won’t part with the component he has now for any price, but he may eventually entrust it to the PCs if they can gain his support (see page 171), or once they prove themselves to be Lamasara’s newest heroes.

### Gross Blockage
- A blockage of the river north of Lamasara has caused [[CompendiumDirectoryPF2e/Bestiaries/Monster Core/Globster|Globster]]s to work their way upstream in search of food. Kill them to keep the shoreline clean!
### Murky Water
- [[CompendiumDirectoryPF2e/Bestiaries/Monster Core/Leukodaemon|Leukodaemon]]  looking to corrupt the river around when the party is level 7. A few weeks in game?
### Sweet Distractions
- 7 [[CompendiumDirectoryPF2e/Bestiaries/Monster Core/Succubus|Succubus]] - a few of them could be working for Zridi and sowing discord. Distracting the right people when they're needed, exploiting desires with manipulation.
### Stone Seer
- 7 [[CompendiumDirectoryPF2e/Bestiaries/Monster Core/Medusa|Medusa]] - posing as an oracle 
### My Favourite coven of Bitches
- A 4 [[Sweet Hag]] and an 6 [[Iron Hag]] are preying on the young in the Lower District. Perhaps when one is dealt with, the other vanishes to re-emerge with a coven later on.
### Mischievious Malcontents
- Gremlins working for Kylas and Deyad 
### Angry Guest 
- 5 [[CompendiumDirectoryPF2e/Bestiaries/Monster Core/Poltergeist|Poltergeist]] - a newly built home is haunted by one, where they built the home on top of its burial site or something it cared about.
### It just takes one! 
- 4 [[Vampire Servitor]] - A vampirism outbreak? Sounds exciting 
- 6 [[CompendiumDirectoryPF2e/Bestiaries/Monster Core/Vampire Count|Vampire Count]] 
- 9 [[CompendiumDirectoryPF2e/Bestiaries/Monster Core/Vampire Mastermind|Vampire Mastermind]]
### An ear full of pain 
- Bulletin board message: "Earrings Stolen: My wagon was robbed by vagrants west of town, in Roar's territory. Among the items taken where heirloom earrings that were given to me by my mother. Please find them. Reward available. Inquire at the Rusty Dragon Inn for details"  
- Mahdin Khossan, a wine merchant coming from Rahadoum had to hand over all of his valuables to make it to Lamasara with his wine and his life. He wants revenge, as the earrings he brought with him were a gift he was planning to present to his fiancé in Qadira. 
### Goin' Hard in the Sheets 
- In the [[Glazen Sheets]], north east of Lamasara, for the last 11 years, there have been rumours of a warlord active. They are said to wield Abat-Ne, the Blackstone Mace. It's an intelligent weapon from long ago

### Holy vapours 
- A priestess from the church of Shelyn (who has been dominated by Jonah) ask the party in person if they would be willing to discreetly procure some Abysium Ingots from the region close to Water Lord Diego's Oasis. She provides the party with light-weight enchanted bags to safely bring the abysium back to town, though it's up to them how to safely get it into the bags in the first place. She cloaks the strangeness of this request by saying that she's starting to show age, and that this method (purified abysium) can stave off wrinkles better than anything, but she wants to keep her methods secret. Offers 20 gp as a down payment, with an extra 10 gp for their secrecy. 20 gp more when they return with the Abysium. 
- Arranges for the drop off to be at [[Theatre District#Carpe Noctem THEATER LOCATION 6|Carpe Noctem]] theatre.

### The Pit of Jealousy 
- A rival hairdresser wants Jonah put out of business, and if the party is affiliated enough with The Other Hand, he hires them to mess with Jonah somehow. This, of course, puts them on Jonah's radar.

### Petrific 
- Message on bulletin board: "Need basilisk eggs for experiment! Big reward!" - [[Lower District#BOTTLED SOLUTIONS LOCATION 3|Nisk Tander]] wants the basilisk eggs for an interesting potion. If the party gets him 3 from a cave southwest of town (2 days away) then he'll pay them 30 gp. 

### Academic Woes
- **Vinn Gharban** (NG male human inventor) needs help with getting his academy up and running 
	- Anything historic that the party finds, he'll pay 110% of normal cost for it. 
	- He has hopes that the ruins to the south yield some decent artifacts. 
	- An artifact he brought from his travels in Rahadoum starts acting strangely (turns out its a relic that must be activated in some way to be of use)
	- Wants a jumbo construct 
### Alms for the Poor 
- The halfling refugees need help because some of their number are vanishing slowly. A [[CompendiumDirectoryPF2e/Bestiaries/Monster Core/Barghest|Barghest]] is feeding off them.
	- When Bripip arrives in town, a month into game, whether or not this has been dealt with will have relevant effects. He could jump start a revolution if left to his own devices. It could create serious change in Thuvia, but all of this comes at the cost of making the citizens more vulnerable to Zridi's *Enmity Cycle*, supplying bodies for Jonah's lichdom plans, and more. Perhaps Jonah keeps finding ways to keep the party busy by pulling strings to throw work at them. 
### Sleep, Little one
- One of the theatres reports being haunted privately. If not dealt with ASAP, the job gets put up on the bulletin board. 
	- 2 [[Attic Whisperer]]s (level 4)
### Influence encounter 
- A theatrical troupe are nearing eviction from ? theatre. They haven't been able to keep up on rent and need someone to get their landlord to go easy on them while they try to get a new gig. There are 3 of them, a woman, a male gnome, and a female catfolk.
	- the PCs try to convince a grizzled landlord to not evict a theatrical troupe from a dilapidated building he owns. It’s a 3rd-level challenge. He is a busy, practical man and gives the PCs only 45 minutes (3 rounds) to make their case. 
	- **DANPHY MOLLWETHER** LEVEL 3 
	- UNIQUE MEDIUM HUMAN HUMANOID 
	- Penny-pinching landlord 
	- **Perception** +9 
	- **Will** +12 
	- **Discovery** DC 13 Mercantile Lore, DC 18 Perception, DC 16 Society 
	- **Influence Skills** DC 16 Accounting Lore (noting how the theater could be made profitable), DC 16 Crafting (volunteering to repair the building), DC 20 Intimidation, DC 20 Performance, DC 22 Diplomacy, DC 24 Deception 
	- **Influence 4** Mr. Mollwether gives the troupe 1 week to get him his back rent, with interest, before evicting them. 
	- **Influence 6** Mr. Mollwether gives the troupe 1 month to get him his back rent before evicting them. 
	- **Influence 8** Mr. Mollwether allows the troupe to stay, reduces their rent, and forgives half their debt. 
	- **Resistances** The landlord thinks in practical terms, with little patience for the “good-for-nothings” of the troupe. Appeals directed at sympathy alone increase the check’s DC by 2. 
	- **Weaknesses** Mr. Mollwether used to visit the theater often as a small child, and performing one of his favorite old songs or plays brings tears to his eyes and reduces the Performance DC by 2. 
	- **Background** Mollwether was raised by wealthy parents who loved the arts and took him to the theater often. A scandal left the family broke, and Danphy clawed his way back up to a decent living. Becoming something of a slumlord, he owns several properties now and still feels he must exploit others to survive. 
	- **Appearance** An elderly man in cheap dress clothes, Mr. Mollwether looks like he’s never felt a moment of love for anyone in his entire life. 
	- **Personality** Impatient, crotchety, skeptical 
	- **Penalty** Antagonizing Mr. Mollwether by “sermonizing” or “wasting his time” causes him to cut the meeting short, reducing it to 2 rounds instead of 3.
