Archer sentries slightly outrank the rank-and-file guards, taking positions on walls, garrisons, and other important locations where they can stay out of the fray and pick off criminals or assailants.

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. In good-aligned societies, these officials carry out their duties fairly. In neutral and evil ones, these officials can be harsh and cruel (with an altered alignment to reflect this), imposing severe punishments on those who can't pay for mercy.
