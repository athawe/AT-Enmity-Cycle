You show off for the crowd. Attempt a Performance check; the DC is determined by the GM but is typically the standard DC for your level or the DC to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on the spectators, whichever is higher. On a success, choose one of the following benefits; on a critical success, choose two benefits:

*   A number of temporary Hit Points equal to your character level; these last for 1 minute.
*   A +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.
*   A +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll before the end of your next turn.
