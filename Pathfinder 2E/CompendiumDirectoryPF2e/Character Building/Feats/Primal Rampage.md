# Primal Rampage
## Feat 13
### [[lizardfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You tap into the unstoppable, primeval strength of your ancient kin. You gain [[Spells/Unfettered Movement|Unfettered Movement]] and [[Spells/Mountain Resilience|Mountain Resilience]] as 4th-rank primal innate spells that you can cast once per day. As a 3-action activity, you can Cast a Spell twice to cast both of these innate spells, as long as they are both still available for the day.
