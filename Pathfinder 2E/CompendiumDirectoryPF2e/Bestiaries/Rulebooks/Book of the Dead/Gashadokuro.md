The dreaded gashadokuro is an undead haunter of the night, spawning as a giant skeleton that rises from the earth in the aftermath of a mass starvation event. These enormous creatures then seek to inflict their unending hunger on the living.

A gashadokuro that comes about due to a poor growing season is more prone to stalk remote village farmlands at night, while a gashadokuro that arose from the victims of a government-instigated food shortage has few compunctions about stomping straight into bustling cities in broad daylight. These latter gashadokuro even seem to target aristocrats and government authorities-whether or not they were the same politicians whose negligence resulted in the famine in the first place-leading many to believe that the gashadokuro seeks to slake its thirst for revenge even more than it seeks to sate its unending hunger.
