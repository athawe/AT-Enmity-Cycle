  - name: "Soul Facsimile"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (occult) The soul slime assumes the shape and features of any Large, Medium, or Small creature whose soul the soul slime has siphoned for up to 1 minute. This doesn't change the soul slime's statistics, only its outward appearance. While transformed in this way, the soul slime can revert to its natural shape as a single action, and the soul slime automatically reverts to its natural shape when it takes physical damage."

Soul slimes are swirling, blue-gray masses of protoplasm that feed on the quintessence contained within souls. Typically, soul slimes acquire this quintessence by consuming the living, the undead, or souls imprisoned in other objects, although soul slimes can also feed on the quintessence of the Outer Planes and their occupants. Soul slimes digest these siphoned souls over decades. As long as a portion of a soul remains undigested, a soul slime can adopt the shape and use the vocalizations of that soulâ€”a tactic soul slimes routinely adopt to get close to their prey while hunting. As soul slimes lack the intelligence to truly impersonate or mimic the souls they digest, they are obvious facsimiles and are entirely incapable of speech.
