**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** armor innovation

**Requirements** You are wearing your armor innovation.

You electrify your armor to punish foes who dare to attack you. For 1 round, any creature that touches you, or that hits you with a melee unarmed attack or a non-reach melee weapon attack, takes 1d4 electricity|overrideTraits damage. The effect ends if you cease wearing your armor innovation.

If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, the damage increases to 2d4.

**Unstable Function** You create an unstable chain reaction, sending countless sparks dancing across your armor. Add the unstable trait to Electrify Armor. The effects last for 1 minute instead of 1 round, and the damage dice increase from d4s to d12s.( 1d12 electricity / 2d12 electricity)
