# Cantorian Reinforcement
## Feat 1
### [[hobgoblin]]

**Category** ancestry; 




The life energy that helped create the first hobgoblins is particularly potent in you, protecting you from ongoing maladies. When you succeed at a saving throw against a disease or poison, you reduce the stage by 2 (or 1 for a virulent disease or poison), and when you critically succeed, you reduce the stage by 3 (or 2 for a virulent disease or poison).
