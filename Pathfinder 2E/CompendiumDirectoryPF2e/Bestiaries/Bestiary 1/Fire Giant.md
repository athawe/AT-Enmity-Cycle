The most militaristic of all giants, fire giants focus obsessively on learning combat techniques, mastering the arts of forging weapons and armor, and finding new ways to dominate their enemies. As a result, their social and political structures are grounded firmly in martial hierarchies, with a strict emphasis on following the orders of one's superior, no matter if you are accountable to a lowly soldier or report to a powerful officer. As soon as a fire giant can walk, they are fitted with their first suit of forged armor. This armor is constantly remolded and replaced as the fire giant matures, both to ensure they are comfortable with steel against their skin and also to teach the giant as early as possible that they bear the burden of fighting to protect their traditions and way of life. To a fire giant, death is the flame in which the future is forged.

Fire giants are usually identified by their powerful stature, bright-orange hair that flickers and dances as if it were aflame, and heavy steel armor worn over garments of crimson, amber, or black. Most fire giants are covered in scars and refuse to conceal or obstruct them, as each jagged mark serves as a reminder of a valuable lesson they learned in battle. A typical fire giant stands 12 to 16 feet tall, weighs about 7,000 pounds, and lives to be 350 years old.

Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout the world. They are divided into a number of subtypes.
