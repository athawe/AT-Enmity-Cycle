# Spellshot Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[class]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** way of the spellshot
* * *
You've steeped yourself in magic and gunplay to the extent that you can conjure bullets from thin air, using a rudimentary knowledge of arcane theory to create a temporary piece of ammunition. You gain the [[Actions/Conjure Bullet|Conjure Bullet]] action.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat other than Beast Gunner Dedication until you've gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Spellshot|Spellshot]] or [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Beast Gunner|Beast Gunner]] archetypes.
