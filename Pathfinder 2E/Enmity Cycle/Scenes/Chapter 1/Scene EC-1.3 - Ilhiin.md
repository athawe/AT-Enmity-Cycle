## Returning to Lamasara
If the PCs already know the location of Ilhiin, they can save themselves a day’s journey by heading almost directly north from the poet’s house across the rocky desert to the village. They might, however, decide to return to the city to report their findings to Tahar, *Gather Information* on Ilhiin and the ancient ruins, or simply resupply. Use the Returning to Tahar (page 20) and Finding a Place to Stay (page 21) sections in Chapter 2 to handle those situations. At this point, Zridi is still unaware of the PCs’ efforts to track down the poet. 
Traveling to Ilhiin from Lamasara takes 2 days by camel over rarely-used rural roads that skirt the edge of the desert and eventually go through rough, hilly terrain. There aren’t any merchants currently traveling that route, although that might change if the PCs wait a few days. 
### ON THE ROAD TO ILHIIN MODERATE 4 
The forces of the local water lord aren’t the only dangers in the lands surrounding Lamasara. While the city’s outskirts are relatively safe, numerous threats still lurk within a few miles, one of which is a tribe of marauding gnolls. They tend to steer clear of settlements and sometimes skirmish with Almeth’s forces, but they’re experts at surviving in the wild and enjoy preying on remote areas and those who travel the roads there. 
**Creatures**: Half a day’s ride from Ilhiin, the PCs are stalked and attacked by a group of marauding bandits who see the group as easy pickings. These gnolls have no connection to Almeth or his raiders but are part of the larger Bleached Teeth tribe. They prefer to set up an ambush using the rocky terrain as cover. They fight until reduced to fewer than *10 Hit Points* or until only one gnoll remains, at which point the survivors flee. 
**Treasure**: In addition to their gear, the gnolls have 22 gp in gems and coins.

## Ilhiin 
The people of Ilhiin live as their ancestors have for centuries: growing crops that tolerate the heat, drawing water from deep aquifers, gathering the sparse seasonal rains in cisterns, and working closely as a community. They venerate the sun, though local beliefs in Sarenrae have been tainted by the false Sarenites living in the Temple of the Scorching Sun, as well as by folk stories that date back to the Nurgal worship once practiced there. While suspicious of outsiders, the villagers are tolerant of visitors, especially those who openly worship Sarenrae. 
Ilhiin is led by a council of elders composed of anyone who’s at least 60 years old. Currently, the council has seven members. Only three extended families live here, and the village has a population of 58. Traders only occasionally pass through the area, so Ilhiin is almost entirely self-sufficient. 
When the PCs arrive in Ilhiin, read or paraphrase the following. 
==A small village with a handful of square, whitewashed buildings stands in a shallow depression of the surrounding rocky desert. The houses are organized in a circle around a central well, a lush, green area with three large date trees that provide shade. Hills rise to the north and west, sheltering the village from the desert winds.==
Unless they’re stealthy when they enter town, the PCs are met with suspicious stares from windows that are quickly shuttered. The citizens of Ilhiin begin with an unfriendly attitude toward the PCs. The DC to Make an Impression on the average villager is 19. After a few minutes, however, one of the town’s leaders ventures forth to talk to the PCs. 
**Nizar Wassim al-Ilhiini** (N human male village elder) has never traveled more than a dozen miles from the village. He’s a short, soft-spoken, elderly Garundi man dressed in simple, white linen robes, and he’s often the first person in the village to greet visitors. Unlike most people in town, his initial attitude toward the PCs is indifferent. He inquires about the PCs’ business in Ilhiin and mentions that they don’t receive many visitors who aren’t regular merchants. If asked directly about the nearby temple, he tries to deflect such questions with comments like, “Yes, there is a temple near here, but the priests prefer privacy,” until his attitude is friendly. If he becomes friendly or helpful, he explains that the temple is 3 miles west of town within a complex of ruins and provides detailed instructions for how to find it. Like everyone else in the village, he believes the place is a temple dedicated to Sarenrae. 
**XP Award**: If the PCs learn the location of the ruins and at least one other piece of information about it, award them 40 XP.
## Temple of the Scorching Sun 

> [!NOTE] Temple Rumors
> After years of serving as a temple for a group of Usij posing as worshippers of Sarenrae, the ruins have sparked many rumors and stories for the locals. Characters who succeed at a *DC 19 Diplomacy check to Gather Information* can learn one of the following bits of information (or two with a critical success). 
> • The Sarenites at the old ruins keep to themselves and only rarely send someone into the town, usually for supplies. 
> • The local farmers have an agreement with the priests of the temple to donate a portion of their crops to the temple in order to keep the worshippers fed. 
> • The temple holds the annual Sun’s Kiss holiday on the summer solstice each year. The town’s children play in the sun during the hottest part of the day until they become sunburned, after which the town holds a feast. A character who succeeds at a *DC 20 Religion check* has never heard of such a holiday; on a critical success, the character knows this holiday doesn’t fit at all within the worship of Sarenrae. 
> • Some kind of spirit occupies the temple or surrounding ruins, and the priests spend much of their time and energy keeping it contained. Over the years, several villagers have attempted to explore and learn more, but none have ever come bac

The faith of Nurgal, although diminished greatly during the Age of Darkness, did preserve a few strongholds within the desert that remained influential far later than almost anywhere else. The dwellers of the desert saw the sun as a power that waged war upon their very existence, and the acolytes of the Shining Scourge mixed the teachings of the sun’s brutal power with their never-ending lust for war. These small groups grew in size and influence as new kingdoms and trade routes made their way through the desert, and eventually joined together to form a complex city dedicated to their god. 
This pyramid and the ruined buildings atop it are all that remain of a larger settlement that served as a center of worship for Nurgal several centuries ago. At its height, hundreds of warriors and priests trained here as elite forces serving their god’s desire for senseless battle. After a long, slow decline precipitated by changing trade routes and the expansion of other gods of war such as Gorum, the city was finally destroyed by a party of adventurers in 4302 ar. It remained empty for almost two centuries, with the presence of the poltergeist serving as a deterrent for curious locals from the nearby village. In 4495, a group of Usij explorers found the place and realized it would serve as a perfect headquarters. They posed as followers of Sarenrae to the locals, which allowed them to incorporate the sun elements of the ruins into their charade. Since then, the ruins have become a local curiosity. A few of the villagers serve as volunteer caretakers, but none of them know the temple’s original purpose or that the temple’s current occupants are anything other than eccentric followers of the Dawnflower. 
Scattered throughout the location are clues of the temple’s original purpose as a center of worship for Nurgal. The initial *Recall Knowledge* check to put these pieces together has a DC of 22, but the DC is lowered by 2 for each additional clue the PCs find. The map for the Temple of the Scorching Sun appears on page 16. 
### APPROACHING THE RUINS 
Characters who follow the directions they learned in Ilhiin can easily locate the ruins of an ancient city perched on a hill after traveling 2 hours by camel to the west of the village. The land here is dry, dusty, and rocky, with only the hardiest plants able to survive. Ancient, crumbled buildings, a few fitted-stone walls, and the occasional cobbles from an ancient road are the only remaining signs of what was once a large city; the rest has been swallowed by the desert or worn away by the wind. In the center of these ruins rises a step pyramid where the false Sarenites dwell. 
Characters who Investigate the ruins can tell there used to be a city here, and those who succeed at a *DC 20 Society or Ancient History Lore check* recognize features of the construction that must place the ruins from around the time of the Jistka Imperium. 
### B1. TRAIL OF BURNING SUN MODERATE 4 
This path across the top of the pyramid was the center of daily worship for the Nurgal cult long ago. The faithful gathered here in the mornings to greet the sun and in the evenings to offer sacrifices for its return the next day. During daylight hours, the warrior monks who lived here trained under the blistering sun in the hottest parts of the day. The Ahriman cult uses it for similar tasks, requiring those who dwell here to stand motionless under the heat of the sun without water, all while telling the locals that this is Sarenrae’s will. 
==A well-worn path runs across the top of the pyramid’s surface from east to west. Scatterings of colorful yellow and orange tiles are all that remain of what must have once been a larger work of art. Weather-worn statues stand at either end of the path, their features eroded and difficult to interpret. In the path’s center is a massive bonfire.==

Characters who *Search* this section of the ruins can uncover hints about the place’s history. A character who succeeds at a *DC 19 Perception check* finds several crudely-made symbols carved on the tiles of the walkway; on a critical success, a character notices that these symbols were carved over the top of something older. A character who succeeds at a *DC 19 Religion check* knows that these symbols appear to be of Sarenrae but have incorrect proportions; with a critical success, they uncover that hidden symbols associated with the worship of Ahriman have been incorporated into the depiction of Sarenrae’s wings. A character who succeeds at a *DC 19 Crafting or Architecture Lore check* notes the construction techniques used here date back at least 2,000 years. A character who critically succeeds also knows this style of building wasn’t one used by Sarenites, although it’s clearly designed to revere a sun-related deity. 
A character who *Investigates* the statues and succeeds at a *DC 19 Perception check* can identify that the statues at either end look out east and west to face the rising and setting sun; with a critical success, they discern pained expressions on the eroded figures. 
**Creatures**: The two Usij cultists here tend to the filth fire and keep it well fueled with the salvaged scraps of wood, trash, and camel dung stored in the nearby buildings. They usually assume any visitors have come here to offer sacrifices to the “holy pyre” and ask for items precious or meaningful to the owners as a sign that the supplicants are earnest. On her last visit, however, Zridi warned the cultists that visitors who wish to stop the holy work of Ahriman might seek out the temple. Unless the PCs are disguised as villagers, therefore, the cultists assume they’re here to investigate. They wait to see if the PCs rid themselves of any precious items before moving to attack. 
One of the cultists spends the first round of combat gathering wood from a nearby pile and tossing it onto the filth fire. This is a 3-action activity that has the concentrate trait. If successful, a 10-foot-diameter cloud of smoke surrounds the filth fire, granting *concealment*. The smoke clears on its own after 2 rounds. 
**Treasure**: One of the cultists carries a *moderate eagle-eye elixir*.

This building originally served as housing for the cult of Nurgal. The current residents use it similarly. 
**Clues**: A character who Investigates and succeeds at a *DC 19 Perception check* finds rusted weapon racks embedded in the walls; with a critical success, they also identify pitted indentations below the rack that suggest maces hung here. The current residents of the ruins use this room as sleeping quarters. A character who succeeds at a *DC 19 Religion check* realizes the tented roof of the building is relatively new and is a strange choice for worshippers of a sun god. 
**Creatures**: These cultists rotate duties with those in area B1 throughout the day. Otherwise, they bide their time here.

**Creatures**: Jimbilin grew up in a nomadic family who roamed the desert as their ancestors had for millennia. When a gnoll raiding party attacked them, only Jimbilin escaped with his life. He wandered the desert for some time, able to survive because of his training. Before long, he found himself at the House of Oblivion, confronted by div guardians. With vengeance in his heart, the halfling walked directly past the divs and entered the place. When he emerged a couple years later, he came out a priest of Ahriman and went forth to do his master’s bidding to bring about vengeance through destruction. Since the storehouse is shielded from the morning sun, the cultists who serve as guards during the night rest here during the day. Jimbilin leads the watch at night with two other cultists. They switch places with the cultists in area B2 when night falls.

### B4. THE THRONE OF NURGAL SEVERE 4 
==This tall, marble structure stands high above the rest of the temple, its walls decorated with geometric shapes that suggest a sun motif. A pair of bronze-clad double doors still appear functional. The interior of the building is ornately carved with images of a blazing, lion-faced sun shining down upon armies as they march into battle. At the north end of the room is a giant marble throne on a raised dais.== 
At its height, this temple dedicated to Nurgal stood as a central place of worship and one of that faith’s only strongholds in the region. Those warriors who wished to gain the blessing of the Shining Scourge came here to speak with its priests and receive specialized combat training. As trade routes, climate, and borders changed, however, the usefulness of this temple faded away alongside the worship of its deity. 
Characters who *Investigate* the room and succeed at a *DC 19 Religion check* can tell this place is definitely not a temple dedicated to Sarenrae because the none of the imagery aligns with her worship. A character who rolls a critical success on this check surmises this temple is actually dedicated to Nurgal, the Lord of Senseless War, a demon lord who was worshipped by the Azlanti, among others. A character who succeeds at a *DC 20 Azlanti Lore, History Lore, or Society check* knows that Nurgal’s worship is rare in this area and has faded away from most of the Inner Sea as a whole. 
One of the carvings of Nurgal along the western side of the throne conceals a secret door built into the massive throne. A character who *Searches and succeeds at a DC 17 Perception check* locates a small button hidden in the scales of the dragon’s tail portion of the carving. Beyond is a stairway leading down to area B5. 
**Creatures**: A fallen priest of Sarenrae, Atajma was once an itinerant priest who discovered this temple by tracking down rumors of a group of Sarenite worshippers in the region. When he arrived, the Usij cultists completely fooled him into believing they revered Sarenrae. Over the course of a few months, his faith was corrupted by the false teachings he learned in the temple. At a crisis of faith and encouraged to challenge the poltergeist alone as a test by the Usij, the priest confronted the undead creature and was defeated. Denied a place in the afterlife, he rose as an undead creature who worships Ahriman and now directs the efforts of the Usij here. 
Two cultists serve Atajma as messengers and personal servants. Although they belong to the group who corrupted Atajma’s faith and caused him to fall, they now see the faithless ecclesiarch as a divine servant and follow his commands without question.

#### SCORCHING SUN CULTIST (2) CREATURE 2 
UNCOMMON NE MEDIUM HUMAN HUMANOID 
**Perception** +9 
**Languages** Common 
**Skills** Athletics +7, Deception +8, Religion +6, Stealth +5 
**Str** +4, **Dex** +1, **Con** +3, **Int** +1, **Wis** +1, **Cha** +3 
**Items** crude wooden religious symbol of Sarenrae, scimitar, scorpion whip, robes 
**AC** 17; **Fort** +11, **Ref** +8, **Will** +5 
**HP** 35 
**Speed** 25 feet 
**Melee** `pf2:1` scimitar +10, **Damage** 1d6+5 slashing 
**Melee** `pf2:1` scorpion whip +10 (disarm, finesse, reach 10 feet, trip), **Damage** 1d4+5 slashing 
**Ranged** `pf2:1` short bow +7, **Damage** 1d6+3 piercing 

**Treasure**: Atajma carries a desiccating scepter, and within the offering coffers is a total of 40 gp in gems, a lesser alchemist’s fire, and a lesser salamander elixir. 
**XP Award**: Among Atajma’s possessions are a series of letters from “Z” demanding service and giving orders to kidnap the poet Valls from his home. One letter explains that the poet is to remain unharmed but taken to the temple and held there until one of Z’s servants comes to fetch him. Another, more recent letter mentions “capturing the tinkerer as well,” but it doesn’t mention Dhia by name. Notably, a comment in the letter mentions that the tinkerer’s house will be easy to find because it has a windmill on the roof. A character who Investigates the letters and succeeds at a DC 18 Religion or Society check gets the sense that whoever wrote these letters is more than just another worshipper of Ahriman, given the commanding tone and references to the god. Once the PCs read these missives and learn some hints about the tinkerer’s residence and a few threads of Zridi’s plot, award them 60 XP. 
### B5. BURIAL VAULT MODERATE 4 
==The blazing sun and heat give way to darkness in this long, narrow room. Numerous stone niches are built into the walls of the chamber, most of them occupied by skeletal remains draped in yellow and orange robes, some missing limbs or skulls. A smaller number of stone sarcophagi lie in a row down the center of the chamber, most of their lids cast aside. Bones, broken pottery, and chunks of stone litter the floor.== 
This sect of Nurgal saw death as the body’s only respite from the driving, burning rays of their god’s light, and so they interred their dead in the darkness while their souls traveled to the sun-blasted Abyssal realm of Kuthan. The tombs here were only discovered when the Usij cultists repurposed the temple and unwittingly disturbed the remaining spiritual essence of a former Nurgalite high priest. **Creatures**: This spirit is all that remains of the original worshippers of the temple of Nurgal—even its name and role in the temple have been long forgotten. The poltergeist formed shortly after the destruction of the temple when a member of the adventuring party who conquered it disturbed the chamber and unwittingly caused the creature to manifest. The current residents of the temple avoid going into the room, but they do know of its existence. None of the cultists except Atajma (when he still lived) have been there. The poltergeist can’t leave this room.

**Site Bound** A poltergeist is tied to a location and can't travel more than 120 feet from the place where it was created or formed. Some poltergeists are instead bound to a specific room, building, or similar area.
**AC** 24; **Fort** +11, **Ref** +16, **Will** +15  
**HP** 75 ([void healing](https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterAbilities.aspx?ID=83), rejuvenation); **Immunities** bleed, [death](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=571) effects, [disease](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=578), [paralyzed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=85), [poison](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=669), precision, [unconscious](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=95); **Resistances** all damage 5 (except [force](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=610), [_ghost touch_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2840), [spirit](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=737), or [vitality](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=509); double resistance vs. non-[magical](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=103))  
**Natural Invisibility** A poltergeist is naturally [invisible](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=83). It becomes visible only when it uses Frighten.
**Rejuvenation** ([occult](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=662)) When a poltergeist is destroyed, it reforms, fully healed, where it was destroyed after 2d4 days. A poltergeist can be permanently destroyed only if someone determines the reason for its existence and sets right whatever prevents the spirit from resting.
**Telekinetic Defense `pf2:r`** **Trigger** A creature approaches within 10 feet of the poltergeist; **Effect** The poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike against the triggering creature.
**Speed** fly 20 feet  
**Ranged** `pf2:1` telekinetic object +15 (+10/+5) ([magical](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [occult](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=120), [range increment 60 feet](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=248)), **Damage** 2d12+2 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing (depending on object)
**Occult Innate Spells** DC 25, attack +15 (**+4 dmg**); **3rd** _[telekinetic maneuver](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=333)_ (at will); **Cantrips** **(3rd)** _[telekinetic hand](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1715)_  
**Frighten** `pf2:1` ([concentrate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [emotion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=60), [fear](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=68), [incapacitation](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [mental](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=106)) **Requirements** The poltergeist must be [invisible](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=83); **Effect** The poltergeist becomes visible, appearing as a skeletal, ghostlike humanoid. Each creature within 30 feet must attempt a *DC 23 Will save,* becoming [frightened 2](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=76) on a failure. On a critical failure, it's also [fleeing](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=74) for as long as it's frightened. On a success, the creature is temporarily immune for 1 minute. At the start of its next turn, the poltergeist becomes invisible again.
**Telekinetic Storm** `pf2:2` ([concentrate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=32), [occult](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=120)) The poltergeist telekinetically throws numerous small objects, such as dozens of pieces of silverware or books, either spreading them out among multiple foes or directing them at one target.
- When this effect is spread out among multiple foes, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike at a –2 penalty against each creature within 30 feet. These count as one attack for the poltergeist's multiple attack penalty, and the penalty doesn't increase until after all the attacks.
- When this effect has only one target, the poltergeist makes a telekinetic object Strike against the target, and the damage increases to 3d12. It deals 1d12 damage on a failure, and no damage on a critical failure.

**Treasure**: Among the remains in the room is a total of 25 gp, an *invisibility potion*, and a *potion of leaping*. 
**Rejuvenation**: The poltergeist can only be permanently destroyed if all the bones in the room are put back in the niches (not necessarily where they originally rested), the sarcophagi’s lids are closed, and a prayer to Nurgal for the faithful fallen is recited while in the room (which a character can do with a successful *DC 19 Religion check*). Award the PCs 20 XP for successfully accomplishing this task. 
### ANGRY TOWNSFOLK MODERATE 4 
Depending on how the PCs handle the exploration of the temple, they might raise the ire of the nearby villagers, who still believe it’s a temple of Sarenrae. While they don’t pose a threat to the PCs and are unwilling to take up arms without extreme provocation, they can make the PCs’ lives difficult if word gets back to Lamasara. Unless the PCs took great care to be quiet during their time at the ruins or avoid the village by stealth, read or paraphrase the following as they leave the ruins. 
==A group of frowning, grim-faced villagers stands in a line. A few hold simple farm tools in a threatening way, but most of the crowd is unarmed. One of them steps forward and angrily says, “What were you doing at the temple? It sounded like you were fighting!”== 
The crowd consists of eight individuals, each with a *Will DC of 15.* They begin with an unfriendly attitude. Once six or more of them become at least friendly, they grumble a bit before returning to their homes. If they become hostile, they hurl insults and call the PCs heathens but don’t initiate or take part in violence. Once hostile, the PCs can’t make any changes to the villagers’ attitudes for 24 hours. Providing irrefutable proof that the ruins’ inhabitants worshipped a deity other than Sarenrae (such as an unholy symbol of Ahriman, a rubbing of the symbols of Nurgal, or any other creative choice) gives the PCs a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to *Coerce or Make an Impression*. If the villagers are attacked, they flee back to Ilhiin. **XP Award**: If the PCs calm the townsfolk and they part ways in peace, award the PCs 10 XP.
