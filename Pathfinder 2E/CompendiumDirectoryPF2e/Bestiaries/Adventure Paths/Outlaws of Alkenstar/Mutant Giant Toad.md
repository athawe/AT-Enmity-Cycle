Mana Wastes mutated giant toad

Mutant giant toads prefer to dwell in polluted refuse heaps, contaminated swaths of sand, or other poisonous wastes. Often afflicted with a vestigial face or limbs, its back is studded with acid-filled pustules.

The magic-warping effects of the Mana Wastes extend to the life forces of creatures unfortunate enough to become lost in the cursed desert. Those who undergo the wasteland's most dramatic metamorphoses are referred to as Mana Wastes mutants.
