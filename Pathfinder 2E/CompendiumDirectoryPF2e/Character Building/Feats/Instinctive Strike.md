# Instinctive Strike `pf2:2`
## Feat 8
### [[barbarian]][[manipulate]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Acute Scent or precise or imprecise scent
* * *
You trust your instincts and your sense of smell, using all of your senses to pinpoint your opponent's location.

Make a melee Strike against an opponent that isn't hiding its scent with an effect like [[Spells/Negate Aroma|Negate Aroma]]. This attack ignores any flat check required due to the target being [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] or [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]].
