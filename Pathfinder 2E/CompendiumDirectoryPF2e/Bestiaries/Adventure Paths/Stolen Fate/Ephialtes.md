Ephialtes velstracs are consummate and fearless hunters of the doomed and the damned.

## Ephialtes Prey

When they catch enough quarry, an ephialtes velstrac returns to the Shadow Plane, bringing victims for other velstracs to use for training or raw material. Velstracs respect ephialtes for their "generosity" in guiding and providing for others of their kind, yet are always wary about making assumptions about the limits of this generosity.
