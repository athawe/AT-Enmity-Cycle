    desc: "  Any creature that Strikes the qurashith with a melee weapon must attempt a DC 37 Reflex check save. On a failure, the creature is disarmed of its weapon, which becomes stuck to the qurashith's body; if the Strike was an unarmed attack, the creature's limb sticks to the qurashith's body and the creature becomes immobilized. A creature must succeed at a DC 31 Athletics check check to retrieve a stuck weapon. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 acid damage and the weapon remains stuck, and on a critical failure, the creature also becomes stuck to the qurashith and becomes [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]]. A stuck creature takes 2d6 acid damage each round it remains stuck to the qurashith and can use an [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] action to try to free itself from the monster (DC 31)."

Qurashith-or "gluttonwings" in the Common tongue-are fearsome, bat-like predators that haunt the upper reaches of Gluttondark's cavern-worlds. These monstrosities are no mere beasts. A qurashith does not simply devour its victims; once it kills its prey, it physically subsumes the creature into its own body, metabolizing the prey's spiritual essence. Close inspection of a qurashith reveals that its body is an amalgamation of the fiend and its extraplanar and mortal victims, bound together by webs of demonic scar tissue and sticky acidic pus. While the individual personalities of a qurashith's victims gradually metabolize and diffuse into its very substance over time, a particularly charismatic or magically powerful victim might exert some influence over the qurashith's mind for a short time.
