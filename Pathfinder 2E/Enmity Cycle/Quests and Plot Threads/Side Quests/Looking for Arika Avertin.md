Once the PCs learn about Arika Avertin’s tragic adventure in the Ruins, they may try to seek her out for more information. With a successful *DC 15 Diplomacy check* to Gather Information, a PC confirms that she still lives in town, but she’s been away for a while with a new group of adventurers. A visit to Lamasara Savories (area 21 on Lamasara’s map) confirms that she’s not in town. Her mother, Alma, is worried about her, and if she trusts the PCs she might ask them to keep an eye out for her. Alma can confirm who Arika’s been adventuring with (see Dinner at the Rusty Dragon on page 35) but isn’t sure where she is now—last she heard, Arika and her new group had headed south to Magnimar. Alma’s had arguments with her daughter about her adventuring lifestyle, and worries that their last fight may have driven a rift between them that might not mend—if the PCs find her, she asks them to let her know that “Mother is worried about you and wants you to come home.
The PCs might also ask the Runewatchers, for this faction is known to keep track of local adventuring groups. The Runewatchers, a relatively new group in town of scholars who study all things Thuvian, can confirm that Arika’s previous adventuring group met a grisly end in the Ruins, but other than knowing that she recently headed to Magnimar to join a new adventuring group, they don’t have much more information about her whereabouts at this time.
