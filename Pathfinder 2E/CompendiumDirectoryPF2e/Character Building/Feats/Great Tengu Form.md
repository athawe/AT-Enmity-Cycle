**Prerequisites** Long-Nosed Form

You take on the imposing form of a large, winged oni.

Once per day, as part of using Long-Nosed Form, you also gain the benefits of 4th-rank [[Spells/Enlarge|Enlarge]] and [[Spells/Fly|Fly]].

This lasts for 5 minutes or until you shift out of your Long-Nosed Form, whichever happens first.
