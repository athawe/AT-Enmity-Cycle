Giant moray eels dwell in warm, tropical waters and build lairs in narrow, twisting caves made of coral. Their size, speed, and powerful bite make them dangerous to divers and fishermen. Giant moray eels have rubbery hides that secrete a layer of mucus, making them difficult to harm with some weapons.

Although these long, narrow fish share similarities in appearance, eels are a diverse group of creatures.
