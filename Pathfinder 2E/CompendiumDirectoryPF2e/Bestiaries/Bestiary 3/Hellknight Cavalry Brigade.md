A cavalry brigade consists of several Hellknights and a single field-maralictor, in the distinctive armor of their order and bearing lances; the maralictor speaks for the brigade, questioning travelers the brigade encounters and barking orders.

A Hellknight brigade is typically based at a keep or other fortification controlling an area measured by a day's ride in every direction-about 25 miles. Farther-ranging missions are possible but require substantial logistical support.
