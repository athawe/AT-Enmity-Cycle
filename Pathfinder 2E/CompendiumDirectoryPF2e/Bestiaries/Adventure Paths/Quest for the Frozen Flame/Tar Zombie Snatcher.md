Creatures that fail the save are [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] and gain fire weakness 5. Both conditions end after 3 rounds or when the tar is scrubbed off (which requires 3 Interact actions). The tar zombie can't Vomit Tar again for 1d4 rounds.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Vomit Tar|Effect: Vomit Tar]]"
