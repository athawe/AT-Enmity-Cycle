    desc: "`pf2:3` (divine) The dragonstorm fire giant raises one hand to the sky, channeling dragonstorm energy into the blade held in the other. The giant makes a greatsword Strike with a -2 circumstance penalty against each creature within its reach. It makes only one attack roll and compares the result against each creature's AC. This Strike deals an additional 1d8 acid, 1d8 cold, 1d8 electricity, 1d8 fire, and 1d8 poison damage and counts as two attacks for the giant's multiple attack penalty."
