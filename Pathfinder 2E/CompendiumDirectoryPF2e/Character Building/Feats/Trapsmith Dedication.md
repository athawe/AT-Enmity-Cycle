# Trapsmith Dedication
## Feat 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Snarecrafter Dedication or Snare Specialist ranger class feat
* * *
You use glimmering gears and gnashing mechanisms to manufacture snares using specialized parts. Your snares include clockwork and steam-powered cogwheels and gears, and their gush of steam can hinder those you ensnare. If you choose to construct a snare using gears and a creature fails their saving throw against the snare, all creatures are concealed to that creature for 1 round, as a burst of steam obscures its vision.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Snarecrafter|Snarecrafter]] or [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Trapsmith|Trapsmith]] archetypes.
