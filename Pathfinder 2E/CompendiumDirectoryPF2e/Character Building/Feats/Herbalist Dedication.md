# Herbalist Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Nature; Natural Medicine
* * *
You can create remedies and other herbal products. You gain the basic alchemy benefits, though they apply only for herbal items: alchemical items with the healing trait, plus [[Equipment/Antidote (Lesser)|Antidote]] and [[Equipment/Antiplague (Lesser)|Antiplague]].

You gain batches of infused reagents per day equal to your level or half your level if you didn't make your daily preparations in the wilderness. Your [[Class Features/Advanced Alchemy|Advanced Alchemy]] level for creating these is 1 and doesn't increase on its own.

You become an expert in Nature and can use Nature instead of Crafting to [[Actions/Craft|Craft]] herbal items. You don't need to be trained in Crafting or have the [[Feats/Alchemical Crafting|Alchemical Crafting]] feat to do so, and you can use a [[Equipment/Healer's Toolkit|Healer's Toolkit]] instead of an [[Equipment/Alchemist's Toolkit|Alchemist's Toolkit]].

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Herbalist|Herbalist]] archetype.
