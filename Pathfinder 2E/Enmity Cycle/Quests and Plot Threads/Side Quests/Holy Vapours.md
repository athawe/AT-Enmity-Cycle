- [[Lamasara's Faithful#Paeda Rosemane|Paeda Rosemane]], a female halfling priestess from the church of Shelyn (who has been dominated by Jonah) ask the party in person if they would be willing to discreetly procure some Abysium Ingots from the region close to Water Lord Diego's Oasis. She provides the party with light-weight enchanted bags to safely bring the abysium back to town, though it's up to them how to safely get it into the bags in the first place. She cloaks the strangeness of this request by saying that she's starting to show age, and that this method (purified abysium) can stave off wrinkles better than anything, but she wants to keep her methods secret. Offers 20 gp as a down payment, with an extra 10 gp for their secrecy. 20 gp more when they return with the Abysium.
