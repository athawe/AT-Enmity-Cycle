    desc: "`pf2:1`  This ability functions as Grab, but the crawling hand grips the throat of a Medium or smaller creature. A creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] this way has difficulty speaking and must spend an extra action to perform any action that requires speaking, including casting spells.\n* * *\n\n**Requirements** The monster's last action was a successful Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or the monster has a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] or [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]]\n* * *\n\n**Effect** If used after a Strike, the monster attempts to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] the creature using the body part it attacked with. This attempt neither applies nor counts toward the creature's multiple attack penalty.\n\nThe monster can instead use Grab and choose one creature it's grabbing or restraining with an appendage that has Grab to automatically extend that condition to the end of the monster's next turn."

A crawling hand formed from the appendage of a Medium creature is quick and agile, skittering in the shadows until it can strike its prey.

* * *

Typically, crawling hands form when severed appendages are endowed with a crude sentience by necromantic energies that turn them into tireless killers. Yet, crawling hands can also arise spontaneously, usually when a creature loses an appendage in a place rife with necromantic energy or with a connection to the Void.
