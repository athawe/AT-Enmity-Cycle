    desc: "`pf2:1` (press) Chops makes a single Strike with a two-handed melee weapon. If he hits a target that is their size or smaller, that creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of the brute's turn, and he can automatically [[Action Macros/Shove_ Athletics|Shove: Athletics]] it with the same benefits as the Shove action (including the critical success effect, if the Strike was a critical hit). If Chops moves to follow the target, that movement doesn't trigger reactions. This Strike has the following failure effect.\n\n**Failure** The target becomes off-guard until the end of Chops's current turn."
