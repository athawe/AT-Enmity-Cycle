# First Revelation
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Oracle Dedication
* * *
You gain your mystery's initial revelation spell. Casting this spell progresses your [[Class Features/Oracular Curse|Oracular Curse]]. Use the minor curse from your mystery, but when you progress it again, instead of your mystery's moderate curse effect, you become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] in addition to the effects of the minor curse.

If you don't have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You can [[Actions/Refocus|Refocus]] by reconciling the conflicting nature of your mystery, which also reduces your curse to minor.
