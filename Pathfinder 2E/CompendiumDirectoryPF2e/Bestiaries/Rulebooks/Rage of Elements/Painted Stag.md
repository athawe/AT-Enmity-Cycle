    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,mental,plant,primal,visual) The stag shakes the wooden plating along its body in a cacophonous clatter that sets its painted patterns dancing. All creatures within 60 feet of the painted stag who can see or hear it must attempt a DC 28 Will check save; a creature [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the stag takes a â€“4 circumstance penalty to its save. Regardless of the result of its save, each creature is temporarily immune for 1 hour.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] by the painted stag for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 2]] and fascinated by the painted stag for as long as it's stunned.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 4]]."
