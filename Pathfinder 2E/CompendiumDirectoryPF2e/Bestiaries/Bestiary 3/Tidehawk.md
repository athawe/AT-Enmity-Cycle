    desc: " (healing,primal) When a tidehawk dies, it melts into a torrent of rainwater. If this rain falls into a body of water, such as an ocean or lake, the tidehawk returns to life fully healed 1d4 rounds later, as if subject to a 6th-rank [[Spells/Resurrect|Resurrect]] ritual. Self-resurrection happens only if there are remains to resurrect; for instance, a tidehawk killed by a [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]] spell can't use this ability. A tidehawk that dies while above land must wait until its rainwater runs or seeps into an appropriate body of water to self-resurrect. A tidehawk can self-resurrect only once per year."

The area becomes difficult terrain until the start of the tidehawk's next turn while the water surges and runs off."

Tidehawks, avian embodiments of the sea and rain, nest in deep underwater crevasses and glide among waves. They feed mostly on large sea life and rise above the surface during or in the aftermath of a rainstorm to bask in the fresh moisture of the air.

Though tidehawks hail from the same mystical family as the legendary phoenix, the two rarely interact due to their different outlooks and elemental affiliations. Phoenixes see tidehawks as flighty and unreliable, while tidehawks view their fiery kin as self-righteous do-gooders who can't resist meddling in mortal affairs. Only particularly evil threats to natural environments can bring them together.
