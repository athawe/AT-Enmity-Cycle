  - name: "Crystal Implant"
    desc: " (divine,mental) The wolf-head shaped crystal implanted in Mogaran's brow pulses with shadowy energy at the start of each of his turns. Any PC who's legendary in Arcana, Occultism, or Religion and sees this can attempt a DC 36 check using one of those skills (DC 36 Arcana check, DC 36 Occultism check, or DC 36 Religion check); on a success, they realize the crystal is manipulating Mogaran's actions in some way. If the crystal is destroyed or deactivated, Mogaran regains control of his actions. The crystal functions as a 19th-level magic item for the purposes of dispel magic, but it can also be destroyed by specifically targeting it (AC 40; Hardness 20; HP 90). Alternately, a character can pry the crystal from Mogaran's brow with a successful DC 36 Athletics check check, which takes an Interact action, but only if Mogaran is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]]."
