When a horrific tragedy results in mass death, the restless spirits of the numerous dead might arise as a ghostly mob. Like other ghosts, ghostly mobs are often unaware they're dead. The spirits trapped within the mob may try to carry out a semblance of their former lives, even though their memories are fragmentary and their forms are insubstantial. When forced to confront their true state, the spirits lash out in pain and violence.
