# Dual Thrower
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication
* * *
You know how to throw two weapons as easily as Strike with them.

Whenever a dual-weapon warrior feat allows you to make a melee Strike, you can instead make a ranged Strike with a thrown weapon or a one-handed ranged weapon you are wielding.

Any effects from these feats that apply to one-handed melee weapons or melee Strikes also apply to one-handed ranged weapons and ranged Strikes.
