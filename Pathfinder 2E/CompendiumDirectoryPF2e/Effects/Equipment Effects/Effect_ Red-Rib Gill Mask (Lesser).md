# Effect: Red-Rib Gill Mask (Lesser)
## Level 2
### 






After Activating the mask, you also gain a +1 item bonus to Fortitude saves against inhaled effects; this bonus is increased to +2 against the deadly volcanic gas known around Terwa Lake as Dead Man's Breath, and possibly against other similar volcanic gases at the GM's discretion.
