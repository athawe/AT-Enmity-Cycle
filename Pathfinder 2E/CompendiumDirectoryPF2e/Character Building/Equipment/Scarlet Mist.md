# Scarlet Mist
## Item 8
### [[alchemical]][[consumable]][[injury]][[poison]]

**Category** poison; 
**Price** 80 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

Derived from a mixture of krooth venom and an agitating agent, scarlet mist causes bleeding that turns into a foaming mist. When a creature under the effects of scarlet mist takes persistent bleed damage from the toxin, creatures within 5 feet take the splash damage. The persistent damage can't be staunched until the poison's effects end. A creature that can't bleed doesn't take the bleed damage or cause the splash damage but can still take the poison damage.

**Saving Throw** DC 25 Fortitude check

**Maximum Duration** 6 rounds

**Stage 1** 3d6 poison, 1d4 bleed, and 1 poison splash damage (1 round)

**Stage 2** 3d6 poison, 2d4 bleed, and 2 poison splash damage (1 round)

**Stage 3** 3d6 poison, 3d4 bleed, and 3 poison splash damage (1 round)
