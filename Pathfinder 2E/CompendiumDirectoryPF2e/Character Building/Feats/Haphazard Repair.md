# Haphazard Repair `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[inventor]][[unstable]]

**Category** class; 




You quickly fix your innovation, at the cost of its stability. You [[Actions/Repair|Repair]] your innovation almost immediately. You don't have to place the innovation on a flat surface, but you do need to be adjacent to it (including holding or wearing it), as well as having a repair kit as normal.

Unstable Check

On a failure, the innovation malfunctions in a spectacular (though harmless) fashion, such as a belch of smoke or shower of sparks, and it becomes incapable of being used for further unstable actions.

On a critical failure, you also take 1 damage.
