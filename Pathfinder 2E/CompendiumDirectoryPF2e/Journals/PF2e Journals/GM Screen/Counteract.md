**Calculating the DC and Counteract Rank**

  

| If the effect is a magical hazard | The DC is in the hazard's stat block. | The counteract rank is the spell rank. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| If the effect is a spell (including Afflictions caused by a spell) | If you know caster's DC | The DC is the Caster's DC. The counteract rank is the spell rank. |
| If you don't know caster's DC | The DC is level-based. The counteract rank is the spell rank. |
| If the effect is an Affliction | If you know Affliction's DC | The DC is in the Affliction's stat block. The counteract rank is half the source's level rounded up. |
| If you don't know Affliction's DC | The DC is level-based. The counteract rank is half the source's level rounded up. |

**Calculating Counteract Modifier and Counteract Rank**

  

| If you are using a spell to counteract an effect | Add your spellcasting proficiency bonus plus your spellcasting attribute modifier, plus any bonuses and penalties that specifially apply to counteract checks. Your counteract rank is your spell's rank. |
| --- | --- |
| If you aren't using a spell to counteract an effect | Add the relevant skill modifier or other appropriate modifier to your check. If you are using an item effect not based on a spell, the counteract rank is half the source's level rounded up. Otherwise, your counteract rank is half your level rounded up. |

Roll a d20 and apply modifiers. Make a check against the effect's DC and determine results.

# Counteracting

Some effects try to counteract spells, afflictions, conditions, or other effects. Counteract checks compare the power of two forces and determine which defeats the other. Successfully counteracting an effect disrupts it, preventing it from having an effect, unless noted otherwise.

When attempting a counteract check, add the relevant skill modifier or other appropriate modifier to your check against the target's DC. If you're counteracting an affliction, the DC is in the affliction's stat block. If it's a spell, use the caster's DC. The GM can also calculate a DC based on the target effect's level. For spells, the counteract check modifier is your spellcasting attribute modifier plus your spellcasting proficiency bonus, plus any bonuses and penalties that specifically apply to counteract checks.

What you can counteract depends on the check result and the target's counteract rank. If an effect is a spell, its rank is the counteract rank. Otherwise, halve its level and round up to determine its counteract rank (minimum couteract rank 0). If an effect's level is unclear and it came from a creature, halve and round up the creature's level.

  

| **Counteract Results** |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical Success** | Counteract the target if its counteract rank is no more than 3 levels higher than your effect's counteract rank. |
| **Success** | Counteract the target if its counteract rank is no more than 1 level higher than your effect's counteract rank. |
| **Failure** | Counteract the target if its counteract rank is lower than your effect's counteract rank. |
| **Critical Failure** | You fail to counteract the target. |
