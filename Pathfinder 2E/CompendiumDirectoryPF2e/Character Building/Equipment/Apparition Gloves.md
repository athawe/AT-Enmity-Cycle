# Apparition Gloves
## Item 2
### [[magical]]


**Price** 25 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** worngloves

This set of gloves translates whatever the wearer says into the signed version of that language by projecting a ghostly, translucent version of the wearer's hands in front of them. The apparition is a purely visual illusion used for communication, so it can't move on its own, nor can it hold or manipulate objects, or attack.
