Male urdefhan war champion

Khurfel leads the largest and most active group of adversaries the heroes face in the Abomination Vaults. His fated confrontation with the heroes is necessary because he holds the Emerald Fulcrum Lens and refuses to give it up as long as he lives, as it symbolizes the leadership of his cult. Khurfel's vision of falling at the heroes' hands doesn't inspire fear-it inspires fury, and he fights against his prophesized enemies as long as breath remains in his body.
