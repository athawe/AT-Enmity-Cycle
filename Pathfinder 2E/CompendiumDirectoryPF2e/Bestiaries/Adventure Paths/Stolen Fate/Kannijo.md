    desc: "  Unlike the typical jiang-shi, Kannijo's [[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Vampire, Jiang-Shi, Basic) Warped Fulu|Warped Fulu]] has been replaced by a card from the Deck of Destiny—a replacement that has largely gone unnoticed by the vampire. Kannijo is immune to spells cast from a magic item without expending a spell slot, such as from a scroll or wand, and also gains the passive abilities granted from _[[Equipment/The Snakebite|The Snakebite]]_ (but not its activation ability). A creature can [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] _The Snakebite_ to remove it (DC 33). This immediately ends Kannijo's immunity to these effects, negates the card's passive effects, and removes Kannijo's fast healing. Kannijo can no longer use _The Snakebite_ as its fulu, but can create a replacement warped fulu by spending 1 uninterrupted hour inscribing a strip of paper (or similar) with a writing instrument."

If the jiang-shi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of their revulsion, they gain the [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] condition, running from the object of their revulsion until they are 10 feet or farther from the object. After 1 round of being exposed to the object of their revulsion, a jiang-shi can attempt a DC 25 Will check save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, they overcome their revulsions for 1d6 rounds (or 1 hour on a critical success).\n*   **Bitter Epiphany** A jiang-shi is afflicted by severe melancholia when reminded of their debased nature and the truth of their existential disconnection from living beings.

Male spirit naga jiangi‑shi vampire

In naga culture, the foul-tempered, unkempt spirit naga holds a contemptible place similar to that of hags in humanoid cultures. These decrepit creatures live out lives of solitude, sought out only by those who are foolish or brave enough to think they can benefit from the spirit naga's powers without paying a heavy price-for most who dare to show such hubris, the price is their own lives.

Spirit nagas seek out desolate ruins and places long associated with death and corruption. These sinister, serpentine beings can be found in abandoned graveyards, crumbled fortresses, rotting swamps, and blighted woodlands. Though they may know little of the actual history of such places, the nagas are nonetheless attracted to the psychic remnants of evil deeds and tormented spirits that remain within the earth and stones there.

Despite their hideous appearance and treatment as pariahs by other nagas, spirit nagas feel a profound pride in their abilities and even in their hermetic existences. They see themselves as connected to a greater force whose mysteries are revealed only to those who can cast off the trappings and morals of "civilized" society. Even so, spirit nagas gleefully accept the worship of other creatures willing to bow to their capricious whims. They often form cults around themselves, using their charm spells and rituals to ensnare the minds of a few key individuals who spread the nagas' foul influence throughout a community.

* * *

Nagas are identifiable by their serpentine bodies and strange, humanlike heads. All nagas have magical abilities and great intelligence, which they combine to advance their own agendas.
