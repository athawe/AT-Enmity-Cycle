Trackless runes are common among hunters and trappers, as well as thieves and anyone [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] pursuit. While wearing trackless footwear, you have a +4 item bonus to the DC to track you. However, this bonus doesn't stack with the status bonus from [[Spells/Vanishing Tracks|Vanishing Tracks]].
