    desc: " (divine,prediction) An azuretzi can anticipate the most likely location of a creature through their supernatural insight into the forces of chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants the azuretzi the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of [[Spells/Veil of Privacy|Veil of Privacy]] or that is otherwise shielded from divination and prediction cannot be noticed via entropy sense."

    desc: " (divine,polymorph) An azuretzi's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the azuretzi takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first.\n\nThe azuretzi is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]], the azuretzi automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones."

If it is successful, it transfers the ongoing spell effect to itself. The creature then becomes temporarily immune to Spell Pilfer for 24 hours."

The azuretzi gains that spell as a mock divine innate spell, and it can cast that spell once as an innate divine spell using its own DC and spell attack. It must do so before 24 hours pass or the mock spell is lost. The creature touched cannot cast the mock spell until the azuretzi casts it first or the 24 hour period passes, whichever comes first.\n\n**Success** As critical success, but the azuretzi has 1 hour to cast the mock spell before it is lost, and the creature touched can cast the spell normally.\n\n**Failure** As critical success, but the azuretzi must cast the mock spell before the end of its next turn or it is lost, and the creature touched can cast the spell normally.\n\n**Critical Failure** Mocking Touch has no effect."

Azuretzis are sinuous, serpentine creatures with dagger-sharp teeth, covered in brilliant blue scales with mottled purple and pink highlights that shimmer in a pareidolic approximation of leering, laughing faces. The Maelstrom's chaotic forces spawn these small proteans from a variety of sources: physical mating between older azuretzis, the paradoxical promotion of bestial naunets, and possibly from mortal petitioners, though azuretzis may just be confusing putative mortal memories with experiences gained from games of mimicry. Never expect azuretzis to operate by any rational, self-consistent rules.

Azuretzis represent the humor of chaos, particularly in the form of mockery and parody via exaggerated mimicry, twisting a target's features into a laughingstock.
