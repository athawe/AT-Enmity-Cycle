Great fruiting trees grow in massive orderly rows in a region of the Plane of Wood called Armory Grove. Over the course of decades, a regiment tree's branches grow heavy, laden with fruits uncannily shaped like people. They're cultivated by retired warriors whose tireless work ensures that these fruits grow into a form suitable for battle. Their efforts instill tactical knowledge in these fruit warriors so they're prepared to fight as soon as they fall from the tree—which they do simultaneously, forming one battle-ready unit. Each soldier is equal in skill and similar in form, with a wooden outer shell that splits into portions as the flesh of the fruit inside ripens. A slain warrior contains seeds within its body that can slowly germinate in rich soil with enough water—or blood. Every battlefield can become a new garden.
