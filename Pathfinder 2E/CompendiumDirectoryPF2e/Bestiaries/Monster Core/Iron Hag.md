Iron hags are kidnappers, targeting those too young to even remember to fight back. They most often snatch babies from their cradles, though they sometimes target fearful children or youths who suffer from anxiety. They then imprison their new wards in towers or enchanted dungeons, terrifying their victims with stories of the outside world to discourage them from even trying to escape. If these methods fail to be effective, iron hags become more straightforward in their methods of imprisonment, insisting it's for their captives' own good.

An iron hag's true form has unnaturally long arms. True to their name, they have teeth made of iron, as well as long iron toenails and claws.

Hags are malevolent predators who use magic and manipulation to lure children and young adults into their clutches. Though their true forms are eldritch and horrifying, hags spend much of their lives disguised as ordinary women. They seek out targets who are unhappy, innocent, or otherwise vulnerable, preying on their weaknesses before snatching them up. The typical hag is abusive, controlling, and narcissistic. Though less malicious hags possibly exist, they rarely reveal their true forms, making them nearly impossible to find.
