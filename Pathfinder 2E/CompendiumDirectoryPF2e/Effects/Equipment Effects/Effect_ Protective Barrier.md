# Effect: Protective Barrier
## Level 17
### 






Granted by [[Vehicles/Vonthos's Golden Bridge|Vonthos's Golden Bridge]]

While the swirling rings of the vehicle don't fully cover the pilot, they offer incredible protection, magically maintaining the temperature within and ablating physical attacks. The pilot is protected from severe cold, severe heat, extreme cold, and extreme heat. The pilot also gains resistance 10 to all physical damage (except adamantine).
