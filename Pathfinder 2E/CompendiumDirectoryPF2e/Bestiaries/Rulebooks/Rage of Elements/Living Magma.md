    desc: " (fire) Any creature that hits the living magma with an unarmed Strike or otherwise touches it takes 10 fire damage. If a gallon or more of water touches the living magma, or if it's affected by a water effect, its outer layer of lava hardens to a rocky shell, deactivating its molten form and imposing weakness 15 to bludgeoning damage. Molten form reactivates if the living magma swims in lava for 1 minute."

    desc: "`pf2:r` (fire) **Frequency** once per round\n\n**Trigger** A creature hits the living magma with a melee weapon\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The living magma attempts an Athletics check check against the triggering creature's Athletics DC. On a success, the living magma traps the weapon in its body and pulls it from the attacker's grasp. A creature can Interact to retrieve the weapon, but the attempt fails unless the creature succeeds at an Athletics check check against the living magma's Fortitude DC (typically 36). If the living magma uses Engulf, it also absorbs all trapped weapons, rendering them unreachable until it dies."

Living magmas can lie dormant for centuries below the earth before they awaken from their slumber in a fiery a volcanic eruption. This is especially dangerous when entire colonies of the molten elementals arise at the same time.

The ifrits of the Dominion of Flame conscript even more of the plane's fire elementals in preparation for new wars in the returned planes, even mobilizing ones that rarely travel near settlements.
