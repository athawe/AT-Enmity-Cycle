Necromancers reaching for the greatest heights of experimentation know that creating a new terror requires exacting, careful work at every stage of the process. In the case of the tenebric giant, this process begins with a tomb giant who dies after consuming a dose of several poisons combined with the shadow ash reagent. This creates the right circumstances for a necromancer to raise them as a tenebric giant. They're particularly obedient to the will of the necromancer who created them and are charged full of energy from the Shadow Plane, which grants them new powers and abilities.
