### Treasure 
- The Pathfinder Society finds a Treasure Map! The source seems slightly dubious.
- It's actually a planted trick from Jonah. The travel to the destination is extra easy. 
- The marked location is the nest of a high-level worm. As the party flees, skeletal archers and mages rise from the sands to pelt them with high-range attacks. Perhaps implement the worm as a complex trap rather than a standard stat block.
