The animal has the standard number of actions, uses its normal stat block, and counts toward the encounter's XP budget normally.\n\nThe beast tamer can spend 1 action to gain the support benefit appropriate to its trained animal. Unlike for an animal companion, this doesn't require the animal to use any of its actions."
