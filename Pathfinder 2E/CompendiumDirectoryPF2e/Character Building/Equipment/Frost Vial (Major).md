The liquid reagents in this vial rapidly absorb heat when exposed to air. A frost vial deals the listed cold damage and cold splash damage. On a hit, the target takes a status penalty to its Speeds until the end of its next turn. Many types of frost vial also grant an item bonus to attack rolls.

You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls, the bomb deals 4d6 cold damage and 4 cold splash damage, and the target takes a -15-foot penalty.
