### Interior Maps

## Notable Locations
### Districts
- #### Grand Market 
	- near the docks.
- #### Flowing Market 
	- best-stocked location for potions and alchemical supplies outside Absalom.
	- three full city blocks 
	- Almost every vendor has a story about how they can trace their training all the way back to Artokus Kirran himself. Given the influence and long career of the famed alchemist, such claims are probably not all simple sales pitches. In addition, the Alchemists’ Guild tightly regulates the market and carries out random testing on the items being sold, establishing a set of standards that are hard to match anywhere else.
### Core Structures
- #### Notable Shops/Services 
	- .
- #### Notable Points of Interest
	- Many schools of alchemy.
	- Temple of the Redeeming Sun 
		- largest temple to Sarenrae in Thuvia.
		- built on Osirion ruins of a temple to Ra, repurposed and reconsecrated 1000s of years ago.
		- Also is a repo for dangerous evil artifacts. The most famous being  a series of inscribed steel plates called the Plaques of the Black Sun. The plaques are an Osiriani translation of the Book of the Damned that detail the cults and traditions dedicated to the archdevil Belial, as well as a number of dangerous, evil spells. While well-defended, there have been several attempted thefts of the plaques in the last few years, and there are whispers of a growing cult of Belial in the city.

## History
- The location was prized by settlers, going back before the Tekritanin League. Was the capital of the Tekritanin League. 
- When Osirion took over, they razed it to the ground and built Merab on the ashes.
- As the birthplace of Artokus Kirran and the spot where the sun orchid elixir was first produced, the reputation of the city as a center of discovery and innovation is undeniable. 
## DM Notes
- *Alchemical Oasis* - As the home to many important schools of alchemy, Merab’s markets have much greater access to alchemical items. Alchemical formulae and items up to *level 20* can be purchased there
- Elemental [wizards](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Wizard "Wizard") and [alchemists](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Alchemist "Alchemist"), most often in [Thuvia](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Thuvia "Thuvia"), also purposefully seek to internalise elemental forces to give birth to sulis. 
- In [Merab](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Merab "Merab"), in particular, sulis are prized for their connection to the four elements, and suli alchemists often have a knack for element-infused creations.
- [Sarenrae](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sarenrae "Sarenrae") is the **patron deity** of Merab, the largest of the five city states.
- It's the largest city in Thuvia and the unofficial capital. (Though they are equal under the law)
- a dynamic, vibrant city with thousands of traders, travelers, and artisans arriving daily from around the region to do business.
- Merab is the primary port and distribution point for Thuvian shipments. Its location on the midpoint of the South Tack keeps plenty of goods from both the eastern and western ends of that trade route flowing through its shops and stalls. Agricultural products and other items from throughout the Inner Sea are sold at the bustling Grand Market near the docks.
- The influence of alchemy is everywhere in Merab. Alchemy is turned to for solutions before magic. 
- Alchemical streetlamps. if any lamp flickers and dies, the academy responsible for it loses prestige.
- Fun idea - look out for [[Ichor Slinger]]s!
