These horse-sized, burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like cities, but ankhravs' predilection for livestock and humanoid flesh ensures that the creatures do not remain in the deep wilderness for long. Desperate farmers whose fields become infested by ankhravs often have little recourse but to seek the aid of adventurers.

Ankhravs are immense, burrowing, and insectile predators, considered by inhabitants of the rural areas of the world to be an all-too-common plague.
