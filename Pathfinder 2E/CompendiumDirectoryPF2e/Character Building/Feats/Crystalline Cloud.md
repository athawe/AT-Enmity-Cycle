# Crystalline Cloud
## Feat 9
### [[aphorite]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Crystalline Dust
* * *
When you use [[Feats/Crystalline Dust|Crystalline Dust]], you can spend one additional action to disperse the motes as a 10-foot-radius cloud centered on you instead of as haze; the activity gains the concentrate trait.

All creatures within the cloud become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it.
