Zealots ferret out plots against their religion and seek justice for their church's followers. This zealot serves [[Deities/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]], but others might serve [[Deities/Abadar|Abadar]], [[Deities/Calistria|Calistria]], [[Deities/Iomedae|Iomedae]], [[Deities/Norgorber|Norgorber]], [[Deities/Pharasma|Pharasma]], [[Deities/Sarenrae|Sarenrae]], or [[Deities/Zon-Kuthon|Zon-Kuthon]]. They often ride a [[Bestiary 1/War Horse|War Horse]] wearing light barding. This horse is an additional monster in the fight.

Religions inspire devout individuals to uphold their tenets. Many of these devotees seek to bring respite and hope, but others have darker motives.
