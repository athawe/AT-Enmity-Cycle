The proud and brazen jabalis of the Plane of Earth value physical skill and love bargaining, games of chance, and working with metal and stone.

Before mortal history, genies were some of the first creations of the cosmos to possess free will. Formed of elemental matter, they traversed the Universe and the six elemental planes of air, earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. The genies who remained on each elemental plane found their matter replaced with those elements. Genies of metal and wood appear in _Pathfinder Rage of Elements_.

## Genie Shuyookhs

Older, wiser, and more powerful genies possess greater power and are revered with the title of shuyookh (typically adjusted to "sheikha" if the genie is female or "sheikh" for a male). Generally at least 5 levels higher than a typical example of their kind, a shuyookh gains additional spells. The basics of shuyookhs appear here in sidebars and are detailed further in _Rage of Elements_.

The most wondrous of their powers is their ability to grant wishes three times per year. This is not an innate ability but a ritual practice passed down over time in an attempt to replicate the wish-granting abilities of janns.
