## Item 17
### [[magical]][[spellheart]]


**Price** 14000 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor-or-a-weapon

The golden religious symbol on the top of this spherical incense holder shifts its form to match the faith of its bearer. You gain no benefit from a _judgment thurible_ if you don't worship a deity or if your deity is true neutral. The spell DC of any spell cast by activating this item is 35.

*   **Armor** After you cast a spell by activating the thurible, the thurible casts circle of protection on you, with a duration of 1 round. You choose the alignment, which must be one opposed by one of your deity's alignments.
*   **Weapon** After you cast a spell by activating the thurible, the weapon gains your choice of an _anarchic_, _axiomatic_, _holy_, or _unholy_ rune until the end of your next turn. The extra damage from this rune is 2d6. You can choose a rune only if it matches an alignment your deity has (_anarchic_ for chaotic, _axiomatic_ for lawful, _holy_ for good, or _unholy_ for evil).
