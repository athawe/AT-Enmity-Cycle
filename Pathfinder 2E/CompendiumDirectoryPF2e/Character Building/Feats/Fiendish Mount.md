Your steed ally manifests a suite of powerful and sinister gifts granted to it by your deity.

It gains darkvision, its maximum Hit Points increase by 40, and it gains weakness 10 to holy damage.

Additionally, it grows wings appropriate for a servitor of your deity (such as bat wings for a devil), granting it a [[Actions/Fly|Fly]] Speed equal to its Speed.

It gains the fiend trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor it has become (such as daemon, demon, or devil).
