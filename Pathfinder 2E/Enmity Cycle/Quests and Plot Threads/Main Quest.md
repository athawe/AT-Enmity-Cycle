Split this into pages for the schemes of each antagonist.

Jonah is the final boss, Zridi and Indrajit work for him. 
## Jonah - Wizard
- Goals - He wants to make Thuvia the next Geb, with him as its leader. Maybe his base is inside of some ruins in Osirion. He could be funding or manipulating her.
- Plans 
	- Part way through the game, strong people that the party know will start vanishing as Jonah kills them to add them to his army.
	- He poses as a hairdresser in town. It gives him ample opportunity to speak with targets privately, enchant them with [[Dominate]] and [[Rewrite Memory]] and more. 
	- Will eventually have to venture to the Cathedral of Claws to perform his lichdom ritual.

## Indrajit the Rakshasa 
- Goals
- Plans 
	- .
	- A group of famous bounty hunters have come to town, we don't know what their goal is here. We already tried to establish contact but our man was killed when he tried to approach them. Find out what they are planning. If they are here because of us, you have the permission to kill them.
- Resources - two sons, Narantaka & Devantaka (destroyer of men, destroyer of gods)

1. Mutual Benefit: The rakshasa and the lich could have a mutual agreement, where the rakshasa provides the lich with valuable information or resources in exchange for protection, wealth, or influence.
    
8. Personal Gain: The rakshasa may see an opportunity to gain status or power by serving a powerful lich, possibly even plotting to overthrow or replace the lich when the time is right.
    
9. Duty: In some cases, the rakshasa might be bound by a curse, magical contract, or other obligation to serve the lich, regardless of their personal feelings towards their master.
## Zridi the Pairaka
- Goals
- Plans 
	- Zridi plans to use the Enmity Cycle to destabilize Thuvia, weakening them for the purpose of causing their eventual decline. This helps Jonah by causing conflict that will move the nation towards unrest, a state where he can work on building his undead army.
