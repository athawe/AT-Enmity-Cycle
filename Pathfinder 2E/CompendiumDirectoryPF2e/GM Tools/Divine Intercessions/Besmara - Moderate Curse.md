# Besmara - Moderate Curse

### 






**Moderate Curse:** You get seasick, becoming [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] whenever you can see the sea or are on a boat at sea. You can't reduce this condition until you can no longer see the sea or are off the boat, though you can manage to stomach enough food and water to survive on a voyage, with extreme discomfort.
