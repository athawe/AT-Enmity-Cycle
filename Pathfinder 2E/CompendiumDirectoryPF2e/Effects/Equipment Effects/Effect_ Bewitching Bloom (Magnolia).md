# Effect: Bewitching Bloom (Magnolia)
## Level 6
### 






Your ally seems more charming, though no one can pinpoint why. They gain a +1 status bonus to Diplomacy checks for 10 minutes. Once on their next turn, the ally can attempt to draw a creature's attention. To do so, the ally must spend 1 action (which has the emotion, mental, and visual traits) to select a creature the ally can see and make eye contact in a way the target can see. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will check save or be [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] with your ally until the end of that ally's next turn. If the save succeeds or the effect ends, the target is temporarily immune to being fascinated by any magnolia bewitching bloom for 24 hours.
