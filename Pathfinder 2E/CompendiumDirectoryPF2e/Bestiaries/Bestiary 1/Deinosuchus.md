The deinosuchus is a primeval relative of the crocodile, and is an enormous predator capable of catching and eating dinosaurs that wander too close to its domain!

Powerful and primeval in appearance, crocodiles are dangerous natural predators that dwell in marshes, riverbeds, swamps, and other wetlands.
