# Stance: Paragon's Guard
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Paragon's Guard|Paragon's Guard]].

* * *

**Requirements** You are wielding a shield

* * *

Once you've had a moment to set your stance, you always have your shield ready without a thought.

While you are in this stance, you constantly have your shield raised as if you'd used the [[Actions/Raise a Shield|Raise a Shield]] action, as long as you meet that action's requirements.
