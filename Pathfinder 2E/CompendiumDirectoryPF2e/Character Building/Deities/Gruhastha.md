# Gruhastha

### 

**Category** deity; 




Gruhastha the Keeper is a deity of understanding, peace, and the collective pursuit of enlightenment. The once-mortal nephew of [[Deities/Irori|Irori]] is believed to have ascended to godhood himself after creating the holy book _Azvadeva Pujila_, fully embodying all divine wisdom within the text. Originating in Vudra, the Keeper's faith has slowly gained popularity in the Inner Sea region, particularly in Jalmeray, where Irori already has a wide following. Gruhastha manifests as a human man with an idealized form, augmented with wings of red and green plumage and a golden mandala as a halo.
