The gods occasionally send messages in dreams to individuals who wander the lands, gaining followers with their oratorical abilities. Some prophets have not received true divine missives, but have misinterpreted normal dreams.

Religions inspire devout individuals to uphold their tenets. Many of these devotees seek to bring respite and hope, but others have darker motives.
