    desc: "A small ball of flame appears in the palm of your hand, and you lash out with it either in melee or at range. Make a spell attack roll against your target's AC. This is normally a ranged attack, but you can also make a melee attack against a creature in your unarmed reach.\n\nOn a success, you deal 2d4 fire damage. On a critical success, the target takes double damage and 1d4 persistent fire damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** Increase the damage by 1d4 and the persistent damage on a critical hit by 1d4."
