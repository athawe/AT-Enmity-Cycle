# Wand of Dumbfounding Doom (6th-level)
## Item 14
### [[emotion]][[fear]][[incapacitation]][[magical]][[mental]][[prediction]][[wand]]


**Price** 4500 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Carvings of skulls, monsters, and all manner of violence decorate this wand of blackened bone, but it makes absurd sounds when Activated, such as a honking horn, a manic giggle, or a daydreamy sigh.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast 6th-rank [[Spells/Impending Doom|Impending Doom]], showing the target a potential death that's gruesome and absurd. If the target becomes [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened]] by the spell, it also becomes [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied]] with a value 1 higher than the frightened value. This lasts for the duration of the spell.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of [[Spells/Impending Doom|Impending Doom]] of the appropriate rank.
