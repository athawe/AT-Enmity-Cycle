Make a blend of reactive and proactive play. Sometimes, the world acts on the players, and sometimes, they chose what they want to do.
The next sun orchid festival is in two months. Zridi wants the Enmity Cycle to be performed in the leadup to the auction. This would cause the event to go awry, possibly wrecking the atmosphere of the auction and cursing many people. Then the whole ordeal would act as a 'super spreader', both to Thuvians and to tourists.

### Jeweled Sages
- The _**sage jewels**_, also known as _**sage stones**_, are [artifacts](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Artifact "Artifact") of [ancient Osirion](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ancient_Osirion "Ancient Osirion") used to pass down knowledge across millennia. These [magical](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Magic "Magic") [gemstones](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Gem "Gem"), which date to at least [-3000 AR](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/-3000_AR "-3000 AR"), have been passed down and rediscovered throughout their history. The [Jeweled Sages](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Jeweled_Sages "Jeweled Sages") are dedicated to locating and reuniting the _sage jewels_.
	- Known _sage jewels_, either intact or destroyed, include the amethyst, diamond, emerald, sapphire, topaz, onyx, spinel,[2](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sage_jewel#cite_note-salvation-of-the-sages-24-2) and ruby[3](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sage_jewel#cite_note-race-to-seeker-s-folly-18-3) _sage jewels_.
- The Jeweled Sages originally formed around [-3000 AR](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/-3000_AR "-3000 AR") to compile the nation's history and catalogue its treasures near the end of its first golden age. It persisted through millennia until scattering within a year of the [Keleshite](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kelesh "Kelesh") invasion in [1532 AR](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/1532_AR "1532 AR")
- Thousands of years later in the 48th century AR, [Amenopheus](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Amenopheus "Amenopheus") acquired the _sapphire sage_ stone and took on the title of Sapphire Sage. He resurrected the order and recruited new sages while pursuing and acquiring further _sage jewels_.
- Known members of the Jeweled Sages include:
	- Amenopheus, the Sapphire Sage
	- [Tahonikepsu](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Tahonikepsu "Tahonikepsu"), the Diamond Sage
	- Sinuhotep, the Amethyst Sage
	- Dhiara, the Topaz Sage
	- Mnesoset, the Spinel Sage
- There have been other Jeweled Sages in history as well, such as the [Ruby Sage](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Ruby_Sage&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ruby Sage (page does not exist)"), and _sage jewels_ that have changed hands repeatedly over the millennia.
- The _emerald sage jewel_ is rumored to be in the possession of [Grandmaster Torch](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Grandmaster_Torch "Grandmaster Torch"), though it is unknown if he is considered a member of the Jeweled Sages.

## Sites

The ancient order of Jeweled Sages once used the underground [Sanctum of the Sages](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sanctum_of_the_Sages "Sanctum of the Sages") as their headquarters
### Footprints of Rovagug
- In addition to humans and [dwarves](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Dwarves "Dwarves"), the region hosts scamps, [manticores](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Manticore "Manticore"), [criosphinxes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Criosphinx&action=edit&redlink=1 "Criosphinx (page does not exist)"), [hierarcosphinxes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Hierarcosphinx&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hierarcosphinx (page does not exist)"), [maftets](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Maftet "Maftet"), and [wyvrens](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Wyvren&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wyvren (page does not exist)"). [Behirs](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Behir "Behir") and [lamias](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lamia "Lamia") live among a number of the hot springs. The region is also infamous for its relatively large number of cults, including those of [Urgathoa](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Urgathoa "Urgathoa"), [Lamashtu](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lamashtu "Lamashtu"), and [Rovagug](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Rovagug "Rovagug"), which flourish in the wastes.
## Katapesh 
- Where the famous drug pesh comes from. 
- Used to be a hotbed of slavery. Outlawed it 3 years ago in official lore, but I'm ignoring that.
# Factions & Organizations
## Lingering Note 
- 

## The Other Hand 
- 

## Pathfinder Society 
- The motto is still "Explore, Report, Cooperate"
- It was only 6 ago (4719 AR) that Pathfinders perished facing the Whispering Tyrant and his minions.
- Independently operating Pathfinders participated in the rise of the Order of Jeweled Sages in Osirion.
- After being reorganized, there are 4 key factions that reflect the founder's core ideals. New members don't have to join one, and can even try out multiple. There are other small ones, like the *Radiant Oath*, the spiritual successor to the *Silver Crusade*.
- Exploration, Knowledge, Fellowship, Protection.
- Envoy's Alliance - leans into cooperation.
- Grand Archive - Knowledge. - can be seen as reckless by members of Vigilant Seal.
	- run by Gorm Greathammer (LN male dwarf prince), one of the most renowned and well-traveled Pathfinders operating currently.
- Horizon Hunters - exploration. 
- Vigilant Seal - protection
- The Decemvirate, the ruling council of the PS. Rarely seen, even to high ranking Pathfinders. 
- Aaqir al’Hakam (N male human aristocrat): Known most publicly as a trade prince of Qadira and one of the most influential merchants in Absalom, Aaqir has strong ties to the Society. He represents Qadira by leading the silk, lumber, and saffron markets in Absalom and acts as a liaison between agents focused on elevating their social and financial status through their exploits with the Society. He also works as one of the Society’s primary investment brokers, keeping the Grand Lodge financially stable. Aaqir runs his business operations from an estate in the Coins owned by his second cousin Lady Nymara, living there with his loving partner Emir Thalzar Gaatan and their three adopted daughters. Their eldest daughter, Alinzia, has taken over a sizable portion of the silk trade; their middle daughter, Vanissi, has petitioned to become one of the youngest students in the Pathfinder Society’s 3-year training program with a graduation date just after her 18th birthday.
- Tahonikepsu (LN female time dragon): After winning a vote to take control of the Jeweled Sages—an order dedicated to seeking a set of artifacts known as the sage jewels—Tahonikepsu, a time dragon who takes the appearance of an Osirian woman with a shaved head, has been on a quest to restore the Sages to their former glory. Due to the Sages’ connection with the Society through Amenopheus, the Sapphire Sage, and the Society’s repeated success at helping Tahonikepsu restore the Sages, she regards them as trustworthy allies. Patient and methodical in her approach, Tahonikepsu has no love for evil magic, and she values historical knowledge and the strength of the Jeweled Sages above all else.
- ![[Pasted image 20240702154749.png]]
- The Peacebuilders are an organization that acts as an overt rival to the PS. They were founded to hold the Society accountable for the collateral damage Pathfinder missions inflict on individuals and communities, working to undermine the Society’s influence (in Absalom) through a sustained propaganda campaign. 
- ambitious scholars and restless wanderers alike seek out the Pathfinder Society. 
- By the end of the training, an ideal candidate can survive in the wild; perform moderate feats of athleticism; read and write at least three languages with proficiency; communicate through Napsu-Sign, the Pathfinders’ system of hand signals (see sidebar); identify common threats; regale listeners with the Society’s history; act with decorum and charm in social affairs; research complex subjects within a library; display an understanding of Golarion’s overarching history; exhibit specialized knowledge of several historical eras or regions; and demonstrate skill with at least three different weapons. In practice, few candidates fulfill all of these criteria, and the three deans typically approve an initiate for advancement so long as they exhibit understanding of these skills (enough to avoid hindering more skilled comrades), literacy, and one or more extraordinary talents that would be a boon to the Society.
- Rules 
	- A Pathfinder must: not fight other Pathfinders, uphold the dignity of the Society, respect their colleagues’ property, and avoid undue risks to the world’s history, culture, and well-being. All of these are intentionally vague. 
- Venture-captains rarely act as overbearing military commanders; most serve as facilitators first and foremost, helping to connect agents with local contacts, leads, maps, and equipment to document the region’s antiquities and cultures. This is to preserve agents' autonomy and foster curiosity instead of quashing independence through rigid commands. 
- Given past Pathfinders’ loyalties to various states or clandestine organizations throughout the Inner Sea, the Society has been blamed for political meddling across the world—and such a characterization has validity. That said, the Society has since cracked down on agents’ secondary affiliations in the hopes of removing political motives from what should be solely academic operations. 
# Important People

# Threats 
### Div Lore or Religion (Recall Knowledge)
Based on the result of a *DC 15 Religion check, a DC 13 Div Lore check*, or another appropriate *DC 13 Lore check to Recall Knowledge*, the PCs might know more information relevant to this adventure about divs and the Usij. Remember this check should be rolled secretly.
**Critical Success** Divs were once genies tasked with aiding mortals in acts of creation. Each div has an obsession from their prior existence, such as the skull-headed doru’s desire for arcane secrets and the aghash’s hatred of all beauty.
**Success** The Usij are cults of fiend-worshippers, dedicated to the foul divs and their fearsome lord, the living destruction known as Ahriman. Their goals always seek to ruin or undermine mortals.
**Critical Failure** Div and Usij favor bargains and deals, always abiding to the letter of the agreement
