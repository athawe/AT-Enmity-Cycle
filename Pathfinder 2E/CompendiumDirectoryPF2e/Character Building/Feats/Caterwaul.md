# Caterwaul `pf2:r`
## Feat 13
### [[auditory]][[catfolk]][[concentrate]][[emotion]][[mental]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** An ally within 30 feet would be reduced to 0 HP but not immediately killed.

* * *

You give a daring yowl in the face of adversity, calling your companion back from the brink of unconsciousness.

Your ally isn't knocked out and remains at 1 Hit Point. Your ally's [[Conditions/Wounded 1|Wounded]] condition still increases by 1 as though they had been dying and recovered.
