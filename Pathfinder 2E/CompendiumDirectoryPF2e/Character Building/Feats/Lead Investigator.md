# Lead Investigator
## Feat 18
### [[exploration]][[investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Clue Them All In
* * *
You spend 1 minute briefing up to four allies about one lead you're pursuing.

Those allies gain the same circumstance bonus you do from [[Actions/Pursue a Lead|Pursue a Lead]] to checks to investigate that lead. This bonus lasts until you cease pursing that lead or for 1 day, whichever comes first. This doesn't confer any other benefits of pursuing a lead, such as adding the circumstance bonus to your saves with [[Feats/Detective's Readiness|Detective's Readiness]].
