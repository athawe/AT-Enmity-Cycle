Prison keepers among velstracs, vincuvicar velstracs thrive on depriving others of freedom.

## Vincuvicar Thrones

Each vincuvicar possesses a personal, spiked iron throneâ€”a symbol of authority. This iron throne is an object with Hardness 20 and 500 Hit Points. If a vincuvicar's throne is destroyed, the velstrac must return to the Shadow Plane to acquire or construct a replacement.
