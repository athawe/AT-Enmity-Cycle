Resembling an enormous, long-legged alligator, the gbahali is larger, stronger, faster, and more cunning than all but the largest of its crocodilian kin. Gbahalis will range far from the banks of the rivers they inhabit to seek prey. With a powerful, squat snout, a gbahali viciously bites their quarry, while their powerful hind legs allow them to leap upon fleeing creatures or stride away to safety when threatened.

Gbahalis are solitary creatures, splitting their time between the rivers that offer easy meals of fish and aquatic snakes and stalking the edges of the hunting territories of larger, meatier prey. Given the option, gbahalis much prefer warm-blooded food, but a hungry or injured gbahali remains near a river where it can more easily consume large fish, snakes, or even crocodiles until it's ready to hunt its preferred quarry once again. An adult gbahali can quickly take down and consume livestock, leaving no sign of its meals but enormous scuffed tracks in the ground, as its jaws are large enough to swallow many creatures whole.

Gbahalis have a basic understanding of humanoid behavior. A gbahali learns quickly to evade trackers and traps, and can skillfully hunt along the fringes of a settlement for months before its presence becomes known. They usually avoid humanoid prey, even when hungry; they know that humanoid communities may hunt them in dogged retaliation for feasting upon a humanoid. Gbahalis therefore prefer to hunt far-ranging livestock like ranch or grazing animals. If another predator threatens a gbahali's territory, it might attack a humanoid, leave messy remains strewn about, and then retreat from the area for several weeks. In this time, it hopes the angry humanoids will hunt and kill its rival, leaving the gbahali an uncontested hunting ground when it returns.
