    desc: "`pf2:r` (primal) **Trigger** An object or creature of at least 1 Bulk crosses an invisible vertical barrier extending 30 feet above and below the rope\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The rope squawks like an angry squirrel from the point where the barrier was breached. This alarm is as loud as a human scream and lasts for 1 minute. If an item or creature is still breaching the barrier at the end of this duration, the alarm immediately triggers again."


  - name: "Reset"
    desc: "The alarm resets immediately. Multiple breaches can cause the alarm to sound in multiple places at the same time, though the alarm can still be triggered only once per round."
