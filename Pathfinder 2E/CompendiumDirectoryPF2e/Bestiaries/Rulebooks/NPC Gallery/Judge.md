These magistrates have the final say on the intent and spirit of the law. Properly exercised, the duty of a judge is the strict adherence to the law regardless of station, with minimal sentimentality toward rationalization and justification of why the law was broken. Yet expectations and practice are not always the same thing. For every unbiased justice, there is one who is zealously confident in their own agenda. In a court case or other legal proceeding, the judge is a 6th-level challenge.

Magistrates are the cogs and gears that keep bureaucracy running, moving the machine along under the inertia of the status quo.
