_The Teamster_ represents the driving force to push on, no matter the circumstance. As long as you have _The Teamster_ invested, all single-target effects that target you and require a saving throw gain the incapacitation trait. If the effect originates from a creature or effect of a level higher than yours, it doesn't gain the incapacitation trait in this way.

**Activate** `pf2:0` envision

**Trigger** you are affected by an ongoing condition

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You push through your largest hindrance. Select one of the following conditions currently affecting you: [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]], [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]], [[Conditions/Controlled|Controlled]], [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]], [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]], [[Conditions/Doomed 1|Doomed]], [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained]], [[Conditions/Dying 1|Dying]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]], [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]], [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened]], [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]], [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions/Persistent Damage|Persistent Damage]], [[Conditions/Petrified|Petrified]], [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]], [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened]], [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed]], [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned]], [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied]], [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], or [[Conditions/Wounded 1|Wounded]]. If the source of the condition is more than 4 levels lower than your current level, The Teamster automatically counters the condition. Otherwise, The Teamster attempts to counter the condition, with a counteract modifier of +31.
