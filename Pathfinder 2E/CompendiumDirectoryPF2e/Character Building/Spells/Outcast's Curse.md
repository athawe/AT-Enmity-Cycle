    desc: "You afflict the target with a curse that makes its presence abrasive and off-putting. The target must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance check, and creatures they encounter have an initial attitude toward them of one step worse (for instance, [[Conditions/Unfriendly|Unfriendly]] instead of [[Conditions/Indifferent|Indifferent]]).\n\n**Failure** As success, but the effect is permanent.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and creatures that the target encounters have an initial attitude toward them of two steps worse."
