The greatest judges among the psychopomps are the massive yamarajes, whose wisdom is legendary and whose edicts are unappealable except to ushers or Pharasma herself. A yamaraj resembles an immense dragon with dark, feathery scales and an emotionless, dispassionate gaze behind a feathered mask. When not serving as the senior magistrates, lords, and generals of the Boneyard, yamarajes pursue highly individualistic hobbies, such as gardening or literature. They are willing to halt in their duties to converse with mortals whose expertise matches their interests.

* * *

Many psychopomps are intimately involved with the Boneyard's massive bureaucracy. Few pursue mercy, justice, or personal gain; their duties to Pharasma and her Boneyard are supreme. Nevertheless, individual psychopomps interpret their duties in different ways, which might put them in conflict with mortals or even with each other.
