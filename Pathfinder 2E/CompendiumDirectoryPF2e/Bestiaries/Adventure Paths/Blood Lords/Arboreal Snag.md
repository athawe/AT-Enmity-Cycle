Arboreals can be victims of undeath like any other living creature, but without bones or flesh, their undead take a different form. When an arboreal shivers to life as undead, it often animates as a snag-a leafless, skeletal dead tree that haunts its forest, attacking any living creature it can catch. An arboreal snag is mindless and difficult to control, but some necromancers use them as forest guardians.

While many arboreals are comfortable remaining still for prolonged periods of time, arboreal snags tend to be restless, meandering in a region they consider their domain. This territory is sometimes evident from battered forest animals or trampled undergrowth that litters the ground, but forest creatures soon learn to avoid the area entirely. It doesn't take long for regions haunted by arboreal snags to grow desolate and unhealthy, and locals often dub such regions as haunted or cursed.
