# Flexible Studies
## Feat 1
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




You've collected a cross-section of information on various disciplines you can refer to when preparing for various tasks. During your daily preparations, you can cram on a certain subject to become temporarily trained in one skill of your choice. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. As this proficiency increase is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or permanent character option like a feat.
