## Dragon Type

At 1st level, choose the type of dragon that influenced your bloodline. You can't change your dragon type later. This affects how some of your bloodline spells function.

The good metallic dragons and their damage types are brass (fire), bronze (electricity), copper (acid), gold (fire), and silver (cold).

The evil chromatic dragons and their damage types are black (acid), blue (electricity), green (poison), red (fire), and white (cold).

## Related bloodline

Because the wyrmblessed and draconic bloodlines have similar origins, they count the same as each other for the purposes of prerequisites and access requirements.
