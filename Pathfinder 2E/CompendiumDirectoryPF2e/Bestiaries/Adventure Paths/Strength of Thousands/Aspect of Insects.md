Variant mukradi

Fearsome centipede-like creatures, mukradis are three-headed predators with a devastating array of breath weapons. A Darklands version of the mukradi is rumored to exist. It's said these variant mukradis have black scales, and all of their heads spew a black, acidic goo that animates before being reabsorbed by the mukradis.
