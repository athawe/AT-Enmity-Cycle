# Wild Winds Initiate
## Feat 8
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** ki spells
* * *
You learn a mystical stance that lets you attack from a distance. You gain the [[Spells/Wild Winds Stance|Wild Winds Stance]] ki spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1.

While entering the stance is a ki spell, the wind crash Strikes the stance grants are not, so you can use them as often as you like while in the stance.
