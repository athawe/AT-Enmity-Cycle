The compsognathus is a small bipedal dinosaur that moves in swift, darting motions. Its bite injects a venom that causes numbness and weakness, a trait that the animal uses to bring down larger prey, although it prefers to scavenge food or snatch up insects and other smaller creatures for its meals. The compsognathus is curious to a fault; most encounters that result in combat with these diminutive dinosaurs result not from the creatures' hunger but from frightened defensive reactions when the dinosaurs' inquisitive natures compel them to enter into situations that inadvertently put them at odds with surprised adventurers.

A compsognathus measures 3 feet long from its head to the tip of its tail and weighs 15 pounds. It is small enough to serve as a house pet or even as a familiar for a spellcaster. In cases where magical links aren't involved, however, those encountering or keeping the creatures would be well-advised to treat them with the same caution one might extend to a pet viper or other poisonous reptile, as they are at best partly tame.

Dinosaurs encompass a staggering range of creatures, from tiny but still dangerous scavengers like the compsognathus to lumbering giants like the ravenous spinosaurus to ornery herbivores like iguanodons. Often sought out and partially domesticated to serve as exotic pets for eccentric aristocrats or dangerous guardians for those eager to protect their holdings with frightening but tamable creatures, dinosaurs are far from limited to lurking in primeval "lost worlds"
