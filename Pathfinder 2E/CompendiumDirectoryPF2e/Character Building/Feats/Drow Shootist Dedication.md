**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in hand crossbow
* * *
Every chance you get, you practice with the hand crossbow to increase your draw speed and accuracy. Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the hand crossbow. If you're at least an expert in a hand crossbow you're using, you gain access to its critical specialization effect. You also gain the [[Adventure-Specific Actions/Shootist's Draw|Shootist's Draw]] action.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Drow Shootist|Drow Shootist]] archetype.
