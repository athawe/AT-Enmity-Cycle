Sphinxes are a family of mystical beings that combine leonine, avian, and usually humanoid features. Though the most common sphinxes are famous on their own merits, the family includes other types of sphinxes as well.

* * *

Lacking the intelligence of their kin, falcon-headed hieracosphinxes are cowardly, cruel-hearted creatures. They guard their territory ruthlessly against weaker intruders.
