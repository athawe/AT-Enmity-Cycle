The halflings refugees from Bripip's village are here, they are harboring a fugitive from the law, someone who has won the trust and respect of the community (who is the fugitive and what did they do). They've been in Lamasara for a few years. Partway through the campaign, a leveled up Bripip arrives to lead them home.
