# Torag - Minor Boon

### 

**Category** deityboon; 




**Minor Boon (Single-Use)** Torag repairs your equipment so you may continue your vigil.

Once, a shield, weapon, or other item you hold or are wearing recovers all of its Hit Points. The item's Hardness doubles for 1 minute.

Torag can grant this boon just as the item would have been destroyed, preventing the item's destruction.

Occasionally, he grants this boon to restore an item important to dwarven history that has already been fully destroyed.
