You combine two different maneuvers together into a single flowing whole. Choose any two of [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], and [[Actions/Trip|Trip]]. Attempt both of the attacks you chose against the same or different creatures, but don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after resolving both attacks.
