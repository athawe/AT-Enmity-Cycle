# Effect: Potion of Minute Echoes
## Level 3
### 






For 1 minute after drinking this potion, you gain a +2 status bonus to Perception checks to hear. In addition, each time you Seek, your hearing becomes a precise sense until the beginning of your next turn, allowing you to pinpoint creatures' locations and otherwise perceive the world in detail by listening to the sound of echoes.
