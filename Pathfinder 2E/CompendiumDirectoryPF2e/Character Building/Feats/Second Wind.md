# Second Wind
## Feat 2
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** class; 




You can enter a second rage, but afterward you need to catch your breath. You can Rage without waiting for 1 minute after the previous Rage (or 1 round, with quick rage), but when you end this second Rage, you're [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] until you rest for 10 minutes.
