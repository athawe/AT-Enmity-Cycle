  - name: "Artificer's Eye"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (arcane,scrying) Ulistul chooses one construct or statue she can currently perceive with a precise sense or with statuesense; usually, her only precise sense is vision. After choosing her target, she begins to perceive the target's surroundings as though she occupied its space. If the target is either an inanimate statue or a mindless creature, she can also verbally interact with nearby creatures (including issuing Artificer's Commands) or cause the target to move subtly, such as moving its mouth. This ability can be sustained indefinitely as long as Ulistul can perceive the target, though her visual stimuli from her own body are harder to process; she's [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] when using her own senses for the effect's duration."
