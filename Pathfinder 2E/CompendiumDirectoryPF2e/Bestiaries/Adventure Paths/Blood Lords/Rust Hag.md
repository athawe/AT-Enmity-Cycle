    desc: "  Any firearm wielded by a rust hag gains the benefits of _+1 striking_ and _[[Equipment/Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]]_ runes, and it functions properly no matter how rusty it gets. In addition, when a rust hag critically hits a target with a firearm, the target must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude check save or be [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 1]]."

  - name: "Rusting Touch"
    desc: "  A rust hag's touch causes metal to rapidly rust and corrode. If the hag succeeds at a Strike with her claw, she deals 2d6 damage (doubled on a critical hit) to a metal item the target is wearing or holding, ignoring its Hardness. If the hag hits an unattended metal item, the item takes this damage automatically. If a creature uses the Shield Block reaction with a metal shield against the hag's claw attack, the shield is automatically broken, but no other item is rusted on that attack. Objects made of skymetal, such as adamantine and orichalcum, are immune to rusting touch."

Rust hags have a knack for technology. They make their homes in hollowed-out factories, abandoned tenements, and other sites of urban decay.

Hags are surprisingly diverse, both in abilities and in their terrain.
