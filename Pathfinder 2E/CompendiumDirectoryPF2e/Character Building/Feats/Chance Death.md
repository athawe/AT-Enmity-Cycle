# Chance Death `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[duskwalker]][[fortune]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You would die as a result of a failed saving throw or recovery check.

Your previous life ended due to sheer poor luck, struck by lightning or choking on a fish bone. You can reroll the triggering recovery check or saving throw, but you must use the new result, even if it's worse than the first roll.

**Special** You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.
