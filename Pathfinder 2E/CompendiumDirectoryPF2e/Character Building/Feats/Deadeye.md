# Deadeye `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[concentrate]][[gunslinger]]

**Category** class;

Until the start of your next turn, you can see invisible creatures and objects as silhouettes defined by the movement of air, slight depressions in the ground, and other tells that less-keen eyes would overlook, which makes them merely [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] from you.
