**District** Riverside Estates
Abandoned aristocrat manor. 
**Special** This now-abandoned manor is infested with *jinkin gremlins* who dwell in the walls. If the PCs are intrigued by Kaleb Lavemar, they may decide to investigate this manor for clues, but this adventure assumes no such insights are found here.
