Most smaller communities have at least one smithy where locals and travelers can have horses shod or equipment repaired. Larger settlements and cities often have a variety of smiths, many specializing in blacksmithing, weapon smithing, armor smithing, or even smelting coins in a mint. The smith is a 6th-level challenge when competing with smithing or other crafting tasks.

Every settlement needs tradespeople to create new products, facilitate commerce, and keep the infrastructure from crumbling. Larger cities often have entire guilds dedicated to the creation of specific goods, managing worker conditions, and working with local governments.
