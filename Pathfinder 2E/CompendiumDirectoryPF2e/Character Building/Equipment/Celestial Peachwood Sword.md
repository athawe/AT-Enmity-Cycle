From blade to pommel, this sword is carved from a branch of the now-extinct celestial peach tree. The blade of this_+3 greater striking [[Equipment/Vitalizing|Vitalizing]] [[Equipment/Holy|Holy]] shortsword_ has ancient runes that can permanently destroy the most powerful undead - if you are willing to pay the price.

An undead creature of 12th level or lower that takes damage from a Strike with the sword takes 10d6 vitality damage (DC 35 Fortitude check). This damage is separate from the Strike itself and isn't included in any effect based on the Strike's damage.
