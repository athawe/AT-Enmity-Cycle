    desc: "`pf2:1` (concentrate,divine,kitsune,polymorph) You transform into a specific alternate form determined by your heritage. If your heritage doesn't list a form, your alternate form is a tailless form, which is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up (typically human). This form is the same age and body type as your true form and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as hair color. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. You lose any unarmed Strikes you gained from a kitsune heritage or ancestry feat in this form. You can remain in your alternate form indefinitely, and you can shift back to your true kitsune form by using this action again."

You must be able to see or hear the prey, or you must be tracking the prey during exploration.\n\nYou gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when you [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] your prey and a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when you [[Actions/Track|Track]] your prey. You also ignore the penalty for making ranged attacks within your second range increment against the prey you're hunting.\n\nYou can have only one creature designated as your prey at a time. If you use Hunt Prey against a creature when you already have a creature designated, the prior creature loses the designation and the new prey gains the designation. Your designation lasts until your next daily preparations."
