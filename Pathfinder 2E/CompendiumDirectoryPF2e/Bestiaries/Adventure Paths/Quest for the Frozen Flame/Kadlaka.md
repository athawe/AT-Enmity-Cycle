This doesn't change their Speed or their attack and damage modifiers with their Strikes but might change the type of damage their melee Strikes deal (typically to bludgeoning). While in their humanoid shape, the kadlaka can't use Wingbeat. Each kadlaka has a fixed humanoid form-they can't adopt a different appearance each time they use this ability.\n\n* * *\n"

    desc: "`pf2:2` (primal,sonic) The kadlaka beats their wings with a mighty peal of thunder. Creatures in a 15-foot emanation take 5d6 sonic damage (DC 21 Fortitude check). On a failed save, the creature is also pushed 5 feet away from the kadlaka.\n\nThe kadlaka can't use Wingbeat again for 1d4 rounds."

Kadlakas-strong, lanky humanoids with raven-like features-combine the most formidable aspects of talented hunters and airborne scouts, to say nothing of their potent magical powers over thunder and lightning. Though they shy from most humanoids, kadlakas readily form friendships with ravens and other birds, and they sometimes make temporary alliances with people who prove themselves capable stewards of wild animals and the natural order of things. When they do settle on a roost-whether for a single season or a lifetime-kadlakas often position themselves as guardians of a natural feature or local flock. Because a kadlaka's natural form might frighten humanoid travelers, they often take on the guise of a human or other common bipedal ancestry to gain information and pass on warnings.
