# Back To Back
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Marshal Dedication
* * *
You excel at watching your allies' backs and helping them watch yours. As long as you and an ally are adjacent to each other, neither of you can become [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] due to flanking unless both of you are flanked. If you're adjacent to more than one ally, all eligible allies can benefit at a given time.

The benefit is negated for everyone if at least you and any one eligible ally are flanked, but not if your allies are flanked and you aren't.
