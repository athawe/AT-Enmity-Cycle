Keepers of knowledge, librarians document discoveries, events, and laws. The best librarians record events twice; once for public record, and again to record how events truly unfolded. A librarian typically knows four to six additional languages, often including Elven and Draconic. A librarian is a 3rd-level challenge for encounters involving research.

True power comes from knowledge: the power to shape the growth of kingdoms by mere whispers, staying three steps ahead of adversaries, or even knowing which flora is best for creating untraceable poisons.
