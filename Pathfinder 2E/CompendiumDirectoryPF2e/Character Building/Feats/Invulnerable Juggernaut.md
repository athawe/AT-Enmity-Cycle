# Invulnerable Juggernaut
## Feat 20
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[barbarian]]

**Category** class; 




You are unstoppable, able to shrug off mortal wounds with ease. You gain resistance equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier to all damage, and your resistance from raging resistance increases to 8 + your Constitution modifier.

In addition, if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, you can end your rage as a reaction to stay at 1 Hit Point. If you do, you become [[Conditions/Wounded 1|Wounded 2]] (or increase your wounded condition by 2 if you are already wounded).
