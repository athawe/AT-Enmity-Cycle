    desc: "Your litany rails against the sin of sloth, interfering with the target's ability to react. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly slothful creature, such as a sloth demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target can't use reactions.\n\n**Failure** The target can't use reactions and is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The target can't use reactions and is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 2]]."
