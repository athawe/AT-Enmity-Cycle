# Whispering Way

### 

**Category** philosophy; 




These cultists believe undeath is the truest form of existence, and life is meant to be spent in preparation for transition to a more glorious unlife after death.

**Edicts** seek methods to become undead (a lich if possible), oppose those who seek to destroy undead, protect necromantic secrets, serve the Whispering Tyrant

**Anathema** destroy necromantic texts (unless they reveal secrets of the Whispering Way), teach others of the Whispering Way other than by whispering, use vitality energy to harm undead
