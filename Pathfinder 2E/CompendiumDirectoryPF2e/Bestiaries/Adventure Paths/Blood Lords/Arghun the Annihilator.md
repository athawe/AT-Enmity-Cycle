Variant elite crawling hand

Typically, crawling hands are formed when severed appendages are endowed with a crude sentience by evil necromantic energies that turn them into tireless killers. Yet crawling hands can also arise spontaneously, usually when a creature loses an appendage in a place rife with necromantic energy or with a connection to the Void.

* * *

A crawling hand formed from the appendage of a Medium creature is quick and agile, skittering in the shadows until it can strike its prey.
