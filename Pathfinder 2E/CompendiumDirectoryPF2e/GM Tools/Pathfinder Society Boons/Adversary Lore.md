# Adversary Lore

### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Generic\]**

**Prerequisites** Tier 1 with the Vigilant Seal

**Cost** 4 Fame

* * *

**Effect** It doesn't matter how powerful your weapons are if you don't know where to strike. Before an adventure, you take time to study a certain category of creatures, making it easier to recall their capabilities later. When you purchase this boon, either select one creature type from **List 1** below, or choose two creature types from **List 2**. While this boon is slotted, you have a +1 circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge about creatures of the selected type(s). If your Reputation Tier for the Vigilant Seal faction is 4, this bonus increases to +2.

**List 1**

*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Aberration]];
*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Animal]];
*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Beast (nature)]] or [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Beast (arcana)]];
*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Construct (arcana)]] or [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Construct (crafting)]];
*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Dragon]];
*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Elemental (arcana)]] or [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Elemental (nature)]];
*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Fiend]] or
*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Undead]].

**List 2**

*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Astral]];
*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Celestial]];
*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Ethereal]];
*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Fey]];
*   [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Fungus]];
