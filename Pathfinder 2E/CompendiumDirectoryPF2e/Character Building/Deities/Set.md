# Set

### 

**Category** deity; 




Set is the most reviled of all the Ancient Osirian pantheon. He is the encroaching desert, the invader, the sandstorm destroying everything in its path, as well as the dead who rise from their graves.

**Edicts** Bring chaos to society, murder those who stand in your way, defeat your foes with personal strength and cunning

**Anathema** Refuse to fight your own battles, destroy a soul instead of turning it to undeath
