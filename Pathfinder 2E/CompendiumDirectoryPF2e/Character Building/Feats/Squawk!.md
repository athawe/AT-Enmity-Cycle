# Squawk! `pf2:r`
## Feat 1
### [[tengu]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Trigger** You critically fail a Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check against a creature that doesn't have the tengu trait.

* * *

You let out an awkward squawk, ruffle your feathers, or fake some other birdlike tic to cover up a social misstep or faux pas. You get a failure on the triggering check, rather than a critical failure. All creatures that witnessed you Squawk are temporarily immune for 24 hours.
