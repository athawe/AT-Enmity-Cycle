# Nethys - Moderate Curse

### 

**Category** curse; 




**Moderate Curse** Your magic wars against itself like Nethys's dueling halves. Whenever you cast a spell, attempt a DC 11 Flat check.

On a failure, if your spell was harmful, you instead cast a beneficial spell of the same rank on your intended targets, and if it was beneficial, you instead cast a harmful spell of the same rank on your intended targets.

If the spell benefited some targets and harmed others, you cast a spell of the same rank that switches who benefited (for instance, changing a heal spell that harmed undead and healed the living to a harm spell that healed undead and harmed the living).

You still lose the spell slot for the spell you were trying to cast.
