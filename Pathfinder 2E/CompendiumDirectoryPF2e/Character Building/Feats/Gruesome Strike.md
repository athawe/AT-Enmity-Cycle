# Gruesome Strike `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** tenets of evil; champion's reaction that grants extra damage with your Strikes
* * *
**Requirements** Your Strikes currently deal extra damage from your champion's reaction.

* * *

Make a Strike against the creature that triggered your champion's reaction. If you hit, the target takes double the extra damage from your reaction and must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 1]].

Regardless of the result, the creature is temporarily immune to your Gruesome Strike for 24 hours.
