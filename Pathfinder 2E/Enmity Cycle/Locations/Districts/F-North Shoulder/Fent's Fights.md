Townsfolk HOUSING VENUE 
**District** North Shoulder 
A massive colosseum-style building that hosts grand tournaments as well as the sun-orchid elixir auctions. A fiesty halfling gladiator owns the arena, which he started when he retired from adventuring. It started as a small passion project of his after a falling out with his party. He loves the climate in Thuvia. The Bowl of Judgment is where warriors are made into legends. Sporting tournaments are held here on a regular basis, highlighted by a yearly event known as the Grand Tournament. At each competition, spectators wager on who will be the winner of the upcoming match. Anyone who can pay the entry fee of 20 gp can sign up to compete. Although most bouts end with one participant yielding or fallingÂ unconscious, death is always a possible outcome in the Bowl of Judgment.
