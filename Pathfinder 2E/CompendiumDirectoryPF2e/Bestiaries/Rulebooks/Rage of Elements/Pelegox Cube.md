    desc: "  Whenever the troop Flies, it first Forms Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves up to its Speed.

Pelegoxes are beings of condensed magnetic energy that fashion bodies for themselves using their surroundings. Though a pelegox's true form is a spherical core, it pulls metal fragments of various shapes and sizes to form a polyhedral shell. Though pelegoxes might develop preferences for a particular form when at rest, they continue to look for new configurations to call their own, happiest when they can experiment with endless possibilities, even if it means dismantling other metallic entities.

These piecemeal creatures move by a combination of magnetic levitation and propulsion, and when that doesn't work, by continuously piercing the ground and shifting their weight forward, looking almost like moving caltrops. Over time, the magnetic signature of a pelegox becomes visible, etched into its body in patterns of concentric lines. These unique designs make it possible to distinguish between individual pelegoxes even when their surface has eroded.

Pelegoxes are quick to form relationships with others of their kind. They delight in combining their individual bodies into ever larger, more elaborate structures and patterns. As such, it is rare to find a pelegox on their ownâ€”they prefer to travel in a clustered form.
