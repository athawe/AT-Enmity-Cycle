# Erastil

### 

**Category** deity; 




Long ago, Erastil was a horned god of the hunt, but his worship evolved to focus on rural communities. Old Deadeye desires nothing more than peaceful lives for his followers, calling them to arms only when that pastoral existence is threatened.

**Edicts** care for your home and family, fulfill your duties, keep the peace, protect the community

**Anathema** abandon your home in its time of need, choose yourself over your community, tarnish your reputation, tell lies

**Areas of Concern** family, farming, hunting, and trade
