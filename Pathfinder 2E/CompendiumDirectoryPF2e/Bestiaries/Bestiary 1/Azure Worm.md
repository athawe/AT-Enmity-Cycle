The azure worm is a deep-blue creature that is more at home in flooded tunnels than dry caves. While an azure worm is a strong swimmer, it prefers to lie in wait within the walls, door, or even ceiling of flooded caverns, ready to spring out and ambush creatures swimming past its hiding spot. The azure worm is particularly hated and feared by Darklands-dwelling cultures, due to the fact that an azure worm that burrows into a tunnel often brings with it waters from the submerged river or lake it calls home. When it becomes obvious that an azure worm is near a Darklands settlement, the inhabitants quickly establishing a hunting party to deal with the menace before it can bring ruin.

Cave worms are gigantic scavengers that bore through the depths of the world, eating whatever material they find. Named for their distinctive colorations, these worms are ravenous and display overwhelming destructive capabilities. Cave worms of different colors and abilities lurk in the more remote corners of the world-tales speak of white worms that dwell within immense glaciers or icebergs and gray worms that burrow through the boneyards of long-forgotten ruins, to name a few.
