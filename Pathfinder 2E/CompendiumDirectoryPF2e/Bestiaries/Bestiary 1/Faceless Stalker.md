Among the subtler of the alghollthu creations were the ugothols-also known as faceless stalkers. These twisted beings used shapeshifting to infiltrate settlements and assassinate key targets. They sowed discord and replaced leaders, causing unwanted organizations to implode and bothersome people to lose face and eventually disappear. Entirely terrestrial in nature, ugothols can easily extend alghollthu plots above the waves for extended periods of time, giving their aquatic masters enhanced reach into these unpleasantly dry realms. Today, most faceless stalkers-like the less dangerous ulat-kinis-pursue programmed goals without the guidance of alghollthu rule. Faceless stalkers prefer to live as close to the sea coast as possible, although they are not aquatic creatures themselves. Most dwell in tiny tribes in marshlands. Others live in the sewers of coastal towns.

By instinct, faceless stalkers seek to sow discord. They replace leaders in humanoid societies, then guide infiltrated settlements down paths of destruction. Among humanoids who have wicked tendencies, a faceless stalker can become a prominent trailblazer, leading a group to new heights of depravity and violence. Inevitably, however, faceless stalker infiltrators lead their followers to ruin. The ugothol eventually moves on-either because its true nature is about to be discovered, or because it has despoiled or devastated all local resources.

An ugothol gains nourishment only through its long, bloodsucking tongue. Their prey bear distinctive triple puncture wounds near major arteries. Corpses bearing such marks are typically the first clues found to uncover a faceless stalker's presence, though sometimes they are overlooked as marks belonging to a vampire or chupacabra.

In bygone millennia, aquatic monsters known as alghollthus used their occult powers to conquer and rule vast parts of the world. Their empires contained countless mortal slaves treated as little more than cattle. Alghollthus shaped their slaves and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative magic. Aberrant horrors from faceless stalkers to mimics can be traced back to this meddling. The rulers of the alghollthu race, the so-called veiled masters, further shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. From the heights of power to the shadows of poverty, the veiled masters manipulated these societies according to their own dark designs, enslaving, killing, or horrifically transforming those who discovered their plans or acted against them.

In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean-both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they'd manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again-this time without alghollthu influence.

Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility-that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.
