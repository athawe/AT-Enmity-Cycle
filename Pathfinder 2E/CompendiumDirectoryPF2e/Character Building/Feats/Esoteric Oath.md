# Esoteric Oath
## Feat 2
### [[champion]][[oath]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** tenets of good
* * *
You've sworn an oath to slay the alien abominations that lurk in the remote corners of Golarion and prey on the weak. You gain following edict: "You must slay aberrations whose actions are in direct opposition to your deity's edicts when you encounter them as long as you have a reasonable chance of success."

Your [[Actions/Retributive Strike|Retributive Strike]] gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against an aberration, or +6 if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used.

Your [[Actions/Glimpse of Redemption|Glimpse of Redemption's]] resistance against damage from an aberration is 7 + your level.

If you use [[Actions/Liberating Step|Liberating Step]] triggered by an aberration, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your Liberating Step, and the ally can Step twice afterward.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Liberating Step (vs. Aberration)|Effect: Liberating Step (vs. Aberration)]]

You don't consider aberrations whose actions are in direct opposition to your deity's edicts to be legitimate authorities, even in nations they rule.
