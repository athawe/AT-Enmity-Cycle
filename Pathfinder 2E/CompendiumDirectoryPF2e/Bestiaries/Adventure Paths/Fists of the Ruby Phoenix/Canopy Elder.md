    desc: "`pf2:2`  The canopy elder releases a dense cloud of pollen from the epiphytes living in its branches. The cloud emanates from the canopy elder in a 40-foot emanation. The cloud doesn't move with the canopy elder and remains in place for 1d6 rounds before dissipating. Creatures inside the cloud become [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]], and all creatures outside the cloud become concealed to creatures within it. Non-plant and non-fungus creatures within the cloud must attempt a DC 38 Fortitude check save. On a failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 3]], and on a critical failure the creature is also [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 minute. Regardless of the result, a creature is then temporarily immune to the sickening and blinding effects of the canopy elder's pollen for 24 hours."

In the densest and oldest jungles, arboreals can reach heights of 200 feet or more. Given thousands of undisturbed years, these massive creatures enter into a symbiotic relationship with a myriad of plants, fungi, and animals to achieve the esteemed status of canopy elder. They provide a safe home for the creatures they host and develop a variety of powers that help them defend their forest realms.
