Choose acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, force, piercing, slashing, sonic, or spirit damage; and choose a 30-foot cone, a 15-foot burst within 120 feet, or a 50-foot line. The blast deals 6d8 damage of the type you chose to each creature in the area.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d8."
