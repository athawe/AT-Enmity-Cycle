    desc: "With a surge of healing energy, you push back against an affliction threatening the target and grant a small amount of healing. The target recovers 3d8 Hit Points.\n\nYou attempt to counteract any one affliction you are aware the target has, suspending its effects for 1 hour on a success rather than removing it.\n\nThe target is then temporarily immune to _delay affliction_ for 1 day. You don't need to have identified the name of the specific affliction, but you do need to be aware of it; for instance, you couldn't delay an ingested poison during its onset period unless you were aware of the poison.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The target recovers an additional 1d8 Hit Points and you can attempt to suspend an additional affliction."
