While it's easy to mistake a grootslang for an elephant upon first glance, once the rest of its body becomes visible, the creature resembles a grotesque puppet manipulated like a marionette from the inside by a snake large enough to swallow a building. A grootslang stands 20 feet tall, with skin like plated armor and a pair of massive forearms. It sports six deadly tusks capable of piercing flesh and bone with ease. The rest of its body extends up to 60 feet long. A grootslang's face resembles that of an elephant, but much like its serpentine cousins, it can unhinge its lower jaw to swallow its prey.

A person encountering a grootslang has a slight chance of reasoning with or bribing the beast, possibly escaping a deadly fate. A hoard of gems is no guarantee of safety, however, and a particularly cruel grootslang will just as likely go back on their word upon receiving the offering.
