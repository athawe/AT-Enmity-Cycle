# Can't Fall Here `pf2:r`
## Feat 13
### [[auditory]][[hobgoblin]][[manipulate]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** An adjacent and willing ally would be reduced to 0 HP but not killed.

* * *

You physically help an ally remain standing and encourage them to push through their pain against dire odds. Your ally doesn't fall unconscious and remains at 1 Hit Point. The ally also gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last for 1 minute. Fighting onward with such an injury isn't without consequence; your ally's [[Conditions/Wounded 1|Wounded]] condition increases by 1.
