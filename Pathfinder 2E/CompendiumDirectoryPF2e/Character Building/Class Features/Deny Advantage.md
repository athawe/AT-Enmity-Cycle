# Deny Advantage
## Feat 3
### [[barbarian]][[rogue]]

**Category** classfeature; 




**Barbarian** Your foes struggle to pass your defenses. You aren't off-guard to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.

**Rogue** As someone who takes advantage of openings, you are careful not to leave such gaps yourself. You aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]], or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.
