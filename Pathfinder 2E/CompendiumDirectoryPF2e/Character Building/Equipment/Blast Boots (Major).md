These sets of rockets come in pairs and strap onto existing footwear (or a creature's feet). Inserting them and aligning them properly takes 1 minute. When you Activate the major blast boots to [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]], you can increase the vertical distance of your High Jump by up to 80 feet. When you Activate them to [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]], you can increase the horizontal distance of your Long Jump by up to 120 feet. Additionally, for 1 minute, the major blast boots remain active, allowing you to clumsily fly through the air for the duration. You gain a 30-foot Fly speed for the duration, but any time you [[Actions/Fly|Fly]], you are [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 1]] until the start of your next turn.
