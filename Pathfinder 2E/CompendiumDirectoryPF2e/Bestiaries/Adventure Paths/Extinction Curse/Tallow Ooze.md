On a failure, the creature takes a -2 circumstance penalty to any attack roll or check to use the item; on a critical failure, the creature drops the item, which lands in a random adjacent square. The creature (or an adjacent ally) can use 1 Interact action to wipe off the grease from an item or from its hands."

Pale yellow and smelling of meat, this unnatural, globular monster is composed entirely of rendered animal fat. A tallow ooze typically results from magical mishaps during the creation of enchanted candles or soaps, or while rendering the fat of a magical beast, though occasionally spellcasters create these beings intentionally.

A tallow ooze hunts other creatures to subsume them into its own body and absorb their fat. Since tallow is solid at room temperature, tallow oozes must metabolize their own bodies to produce enough heat to remain gelatinous. A tallow ooze that cannot replenish itself with absorbed fat will either consume itself or solidify, though a tallow ooze exposed to too much heat might melt entirely.
