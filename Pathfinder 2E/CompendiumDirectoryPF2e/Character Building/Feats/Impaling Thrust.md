You impale your enemy and hold them in place with your weapon. Make a melee Strike with the required weapon. If the Strike hits and deals damage, your target is [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] until they successfully [[Actions/Escape|Escape]], you attack with the required weapon, or you Release the required weapon, whichever comes first.
