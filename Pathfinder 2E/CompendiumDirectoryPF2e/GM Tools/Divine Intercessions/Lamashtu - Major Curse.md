# Lamashtu - Major Curse

### 

**Category** curse; 




**Major Curse** Your dreams are an unending stream of nightmares. You need 16 hours of rest to try to get enough sleep to recover resources in daily preparation that normally require an 8-hour rest, and even then, you must succeed at a DC 15 Flat check to do so, and you are still fatigued on a successful check.
