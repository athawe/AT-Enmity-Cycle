    desc: "  Like normal objects, an animated furnace has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage the furnace takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once an animated furnace is reduced to fewer than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks, removing the Hardness and reducing its Armor Class to 26."

This huge forge or oven is animated to protect a workspace or kitchen, travel alongside its owner, or both.

Many animated objects have useful functions but become dangers when uncontrolled.
