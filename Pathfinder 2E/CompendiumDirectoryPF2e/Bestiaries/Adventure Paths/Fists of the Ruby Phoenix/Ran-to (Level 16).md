His maximum distance is 75 feet. He must succeed at an Athletics check to perform the leap as usual, but regardless of the type of leap the DC is equal to half the number of feet he moves in the air. Ran-to can attempt an Athletics check to [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]] at any point during the jump. Immediately after the attempt, he (and the creature, if the Grapple was successful) falls to the ground. Ran-to takes no falling damage when using this ability, but the grabbed creature takes the appropriate amount of falling damage as if they had fallen the distance moved."
