# Stance: Peafowl Stance

### 






Granted by [[Feats/Peafowl Stance|Peafowl Stance]]

You enter a tall and proud stance while remaining mobile, with all the grace and composure of a peafowl.

While in this stance, the only Strikes you can make are melee Strikes with the required sword. Once per round, after you hit with a monk sword Strike, you can Step as a free action as your next action.
