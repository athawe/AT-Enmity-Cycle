Vorvashali Voon runs the Feathered Serpent, Lamasara’s only curio shop, and as such, he makes it a point to get to know adventurers—after all, their discoveries keep his shelves stocked! The first time the PCs return from the Ruins and are at least **5th** level, they find a message from Vorvashali waiting for them, inviting them to pay him a visit at his shop and offering a 5% discount on that visit. 
When the PCs visit, they find Vorvashali has prepared for their arrival with a delicious tray of baked goods and candies from Lamasara Savories. He closes the shop as they enter and invites them to have a seat at the least-cluttered table in the shop, and as he feeds them baked goods, he asks them to recount their latest adventures in the Ruins. 
At some point during the conversation, he produces a curious object—what appears to be the wingless, headless, legless body of a clockwork bird about the size of a blue jay. Vorvashali tells the PCs that an adventurer claimed to have found the part in a goblin’s den on Devil’s Platter, and he’s eager to find more parts of the bird if they’re out there. He asks the PCs to keep an eye out for parts that might fit this bird (he suspects there are five more parts—a pair of wings, the head, the tail, the feet, and the winding mechanism), and says that he’ll pay 50 gp for each songbird part they find and bring him. 
Unknown to Vorvashali, when completed, this clockwork songbird’s song can be used to open a vault door deep in the Ruins (see area H13). He won’t part with the component he has now for any price, but he may eventually entrust it to the PCs if they can gain his support (see page 171), or once they prove themselves to be Lamasara’s newest heroes.
