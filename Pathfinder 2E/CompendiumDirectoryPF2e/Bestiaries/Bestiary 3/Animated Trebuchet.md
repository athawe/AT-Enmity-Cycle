    desc: "  Like normal objects, an animated trebuchet has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage the trebuchet takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once an animated trebuchet is reduced to fewer than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks, removing the Hardness and reducing its Armor Class to 32."

The creature takes 4d12 bludgeoning damage plus the appropriate falling damage. If the flung creature lands on another creature, the creature it lands on takes the same amount of bludgeoning damage (DC 33 Reflex check save).\n\nOn a successful Launch, the animated trebuchet must Interact to reposition its arm into the proper position before it can Launch again."

Large armies sometimes pay exorbitant fees to animate their siege weapons.

Many animated objects have useful functions but become dangers when uncontrolled.
