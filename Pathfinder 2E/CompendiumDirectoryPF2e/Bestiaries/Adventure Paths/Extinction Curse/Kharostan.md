The rage lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies Kharostan can perceive, or until Kharostan falls unconscious.

He gains a +2 status bonus to attack rolls, a -2 status penalty to AC, and a -1 status penalty to saves. He can also make a Wicked Bite each time he damages a creature with his jaws Strike, in addition to the usual once per round usage for a free action. These effects last until his rage ends or he has more than 140 Hit Points, whichever comes first."

  - name: "Wicked Bite"
    desc: "  **Trigger** Kharostan damages a creature with a jaws Strike\n\n**Frequency** once per round\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Kharostan's bite leaves the victim's flesh translucent around the site of the injury. He chooses one of the effects below, each of which requires the damaged creature to attempt a DC 37 Fortitude check save.\n\nIf the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature takes both effects, rolling the saving throw once and using the result for both effects.\n\n*   **Drain Blood** Kharostan drinks some of the victim's blood. On a failed save, the victim is [[Conditions/Doomed 1|Doomed 1]] and [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 1]], and Kharostan regains 20 HP (on a critical failure, the creature is [[Conditions/Doomed 1|Doomed 2]] and [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 2]], and Kharostan regains 40 HP).\n*   **Drain Vitality** (necromancy) Kharostan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 3]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."
