You summon an aura of crashing waves.

For 1 minute, you gain [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealment]] against creatures more than 5 feet away, and any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you suffers 1d12 bludgeoning damage (Reflex check save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher).

At 13th and 17th level, this damage increases by 1d12.
