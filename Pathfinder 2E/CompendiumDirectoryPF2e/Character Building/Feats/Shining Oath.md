# Shining Oath
## Feat 2
### [[champion]][[oath]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** tenets of good
* * *
You've sworn an oath to put the undead to rest. You gain the following edict: "You must end the existence of undead you encounter as long as you have a reasonable chance of success; in the unlikely event you find an undead that isn't unholy, you can try to work out a more peaceful way to help it recover from its undead state rather than destroying it in combat, such as helping it complete its unfinished business and find peace."

Your [[Actions/Retributive Strike|Retributive Strike]] gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against an undead, or +6 if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used.

Your [[Actions/Glimpse of Redemption|Glimpse of Redemption's]] resistance against damage from an undead is 7 + your level.

If you use [[Actions/Liberating Step|Liberating Step]] triggered by an undead, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your Liberating Step, and the ally can Step twice afterward.

[[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Liberating Step (vs. Undead)|Effect: Liberating Step (vs. Undead)]]

You don't consider undead to be legitimate authorities, even in nations ruled by undead.
