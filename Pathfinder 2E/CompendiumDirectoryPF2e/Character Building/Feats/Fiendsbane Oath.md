## Feat 2
### [[champion]][[oath]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** tenets of good
* * *
You've sworn an oath to banish the corruption of fiends to the dark planes they call home. You gain the following edict: "You must banish or slay fiends you come across as long as you have a reasonable chance of success; in the incredibly unlikely event you find a fiend that isn't unholy, you don't have to banish or kill it."

Your [[Actions/Retributive Strike|Retributive Strike]] gains a +4 circumstance bonus to damage against a fiend, or a +6 circumstance bonus if you have master proficiency with the weapon you used.

Your [[Actions/Glimpse of Redemption|Glimpse of Redemption's]] resistance against damage from a fiend is 7 + your level.

If you use [[Actions/Liberating Step|Liberating Step]] triggered by a fiend, your ally gains a +4 circumstance bonus to checks granted by your Liberating Step, and the ally can Step twice afterward.

You don't consider fiends to be legitimate authorities, even in nations ruled by fiends.
