# Agile Maneuvers

### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Athletics

You easily maneuver against your foes. Your [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], and [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] actions have a lower multiple attack penalty: -4 instead of -5 if they're the second attack on your turn, or -8 instead of -10 if they're the third or subsequent attack on your turn.
