A kraken is an enormous, squid-like leviathan with a cruel intelligence. It hunts ships, whales, and heroes alike. The hatred and envy krakens hold for their rivals, the alghollthus, has led many krakens to make their lairs in sunken cities, where they can sift through ancient lore for long-lost arcane secrets.
