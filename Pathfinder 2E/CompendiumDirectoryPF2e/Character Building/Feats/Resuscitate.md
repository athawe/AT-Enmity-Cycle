# Resuscitate `pf2:3`
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]][[healing]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Medic Dedication; legendary in Medicine
* * *
**Requirements** You are holding a [[Equipment/Healer's Toolkit|Healer's Toolkit]] or are wearing them and have a hand free. Also, the target's body is mostly intact.

* * *

You can use Medicine to resuscitate the dead. Attempt a DC 40 Medicine check check to revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than 3 rounds. If you succeed, the target returns to life with the effects of [[Spells/Raise Dead|Raise Dead]], except it still has the [[Conditions/Wounded 1|Wounded]] condition it had before [[Conditions/Dying 1|Dying]], increased by 1 (or wounded 1 if it wasn't wounded before dying). Whether you succeed or fail, the target is temporarily immune to Resuscitate for 1 day.
