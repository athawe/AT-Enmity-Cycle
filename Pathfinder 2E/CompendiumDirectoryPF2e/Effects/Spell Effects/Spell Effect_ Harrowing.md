# Spell Effect: Harrowing
## Level 1
### 






**Critical Success** The target gains agency over fate and chance while in the pursuit of their goal, gaining a "wild card." Randomly determine a harrow suit, either by rolling 1d6 or by drawing a card from a full harrow deck, and then consult the Associated Suit Checks table below. At any point during _harrowing_'s duration, the creature can expend this wild card to immediately reroll any associated check they just made, gaining a +4 status bonus to the reroll. They must use the second result. Once this reroll is taken and the wild card is spent, the _harrowing_ ritual's effects end.

**Success** As critical success, but the wild card does not grant a status bonus to the reroll.

**Failure** As success, but the wild card instead grants a â€“4 status penalty to the reroll.
