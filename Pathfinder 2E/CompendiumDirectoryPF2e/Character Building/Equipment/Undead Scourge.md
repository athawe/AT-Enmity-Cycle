An _undead scourge_ is a _+1 striking disrupting dagger_ with a bluish-white metal blade that emits a faint glow. These used to be weapons of Pharasmin undead slayers only, but the slayers have since shared these daggers with the Knights of Lastwall.

**Activate** `pf2:0` Interact

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You damage an undead creature with the undead scourge

* * *

**Effect** You disrupt the undead's connection to void energy. For 1 minute, the undead damaged with the dagger can't be healed by void energy unless the effect attempting to heal the undead first counteracts the undead scourge's effect, with a counteract rank of 4 and DC of 25. Vitality energy still has the usual effects on the undead.
