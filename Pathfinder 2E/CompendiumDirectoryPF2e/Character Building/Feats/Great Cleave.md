# Great Cleave
## Feat 10
### [[barbarian]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Cleave
* * *
Your fury carries your weapon through multiple foes. When you [[Feats/Cleave|Cleave]], if your Strike also kills or knocks the target unconscious, you can continue to make melee Strikes until you make a Strike that doesn't kill or knock a creature unconscious, or until there are no creatures adjacent to the most recent creature you attacked while Cleaving, whichever comes first.
