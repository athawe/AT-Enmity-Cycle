The most important setting goal is to establish existing tension and potential sources of conflict. You don’t want to bury your setting’s inspirational spark beneath information that will likely never be referenced.
- Fun social scenes 
	- Salmus (human tiefling Bard 5), is trying to woe Francesca, one of the gladiators (catfolk fighter 5)(dommy mommy). Two things are working against Salmus though: Francesca already has a secret fiancé and Ricardo isn't as good of a bard as he thinks.
	- A Tiefling merchant selling potions for 20% cheaper than market price out of a rickety travelling wagon. When asked about the origin of the potions, only vague answers are given. They were stolen from a shipment to Pillbug's Pantry. After a few days, he vanishes without a trace, as The Other Hand deals with business.
	- Some young men and halfling have stolen a large keg of what they think is ale. They are pushing it laboriously up a steep hill, joking and grunting from the effort. A few minutes later a frantic alchemist can be seen running around asking if anyone has seen a barrel of Alchemists Fire that has disappeared.
	- Two lovebirds with disapproving parents meet in secret. One from Deyad's group, the other from Kylas'.
