Nasurgeths are hungry voids with glowing eyestalks and thousands of teeth. They lurk deep beneath the waves where the sunlight doesn't reach. At night, they ascend to the skies and rain destruction and ruin down on all the living.

* * *

Darvakkas, also called nightshades, are a ravenous evil made up of equal parts darkness and malice. Originally creatures of the Outer Planes who travel to the convergence of the Shadow Plane and the Void—where the power of nothingness obliterates them—these undead abominations are the physical embodiment of entropy. They burn with an intense hatred for all life, working to bring a final, dark night to the Material Plane where nothing but ash and ice remain.

As creatures twisted by darkness and shadow, darvakkas have a great aversion to sunlight and all sources of vitality energy. On the Material Plane, they spend the hours of daylight hidden below ground, amid ruins, or submerged deep in the ocean's darkest chasms beyond the reach of the sun's rays, emerging when darkness shelters them overhead.

Darvakkas have an aura of entropy that attracts undead thralls to serve as warriors and heralds. They rarely seek alliances with each other or other creatures, existing in solitude as the heads of individual armies of the dead.
