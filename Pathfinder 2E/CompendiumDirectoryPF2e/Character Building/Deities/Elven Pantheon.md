# Elven Pantheon

### 

**Category** pantheon; 




The traditional deities of the elven pantheon are [[Deities/Calistria|Calistria]], [[Deities/Desna|Desna]], [[Deities/Findeladlara|Findeladlara]] (goddess of twilight and traditional art and architecture), [[Deities/Ketephys|Ketephys]] (god of hunting and the moon), and [[Deities/Yuelral|Yuelral]] (goddess of gems, craft, and magic). Elves have also adopted [[Deities/Alseta|Alseta]], a minor goddess of doors and transitions, as their patron of teleportation and aiudara (commonly known as elf gates). Most elves value magic, beauty, freedom, and friendship as part of a fulfilling life and tend to worship all of the deities together as exemplars of these values. Alongside full-blooded elves, many half-elves-whether raised by elves or seeking a closer connection to their elven heritage- worship the elven pantheon.
