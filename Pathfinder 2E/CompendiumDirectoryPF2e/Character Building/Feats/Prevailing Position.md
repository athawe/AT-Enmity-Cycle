# Prevailing Position `pf2:r`
## Feat 10
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** at least one stance feat
* * *
**Trigger** You are targeted by an attack or attempt a Reflex saving throw against a damaging effect, and you are in a stance.

* * *

Your willingness to flow from one stance to another lets you sacrifice their benefits to better protect yourself.

You leave the stance you were in, gaining a +4 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw or to your AC against the triggering attack.
