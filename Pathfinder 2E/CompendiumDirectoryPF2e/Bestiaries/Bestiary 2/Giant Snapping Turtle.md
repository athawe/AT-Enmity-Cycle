If the regular-sized snapping turtle is foul-tempered, then the giant snapping turtle seems to be willfully violent toward anything that dares intrude upon its domain. Measuring over 20 feet long and weighing thousands of pounds, this creature is capable of swallowing a humanoid whole. Swamp-dwelling societies, particularly boggards and lizardfolk, have often tried to domesticate giant snapping turtles to serve as powerful guardians, but in most cases the casualties pile up quickly. Those unfortunate enough to be swallowed whole by a giant snapping turtle find that even the creature's stomach is somewhat armored, making it difficult to cut through.
