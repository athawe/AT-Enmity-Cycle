# Pirate Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Intimidation

As a pirate, you sail the seas in search of enemy ships to plunder. You become trained in Sailing Lore, or become an expert in it if you were already trained.

You ignore the effects of difficult terrain or uneven ground caused by a ship's movement. Additionally, you gain the [[Actions/Boarding Assault|Boarding Assault]] action.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Pirate|Pirate]] archetype.
