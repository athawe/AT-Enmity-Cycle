# Antler Arrow
## Item 2
### [[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** ammo; 
**Price** 7 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

Creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter with a horned archon scout who sought to peacefully restrain their foes. When an activated antler arrow hits a target, bone antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex check save or become stuck to the surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a bow.

If the hit with the _antler arrow_ is a critical hit and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the Athletics check increases to 15.
