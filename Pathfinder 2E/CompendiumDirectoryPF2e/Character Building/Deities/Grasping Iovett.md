# Grasping Iovett

### 

**Category** deity; 




A beautiful form of indescribable variety, Iovett is the Forsaken patron of accidents, parasites, and reckless lust.

* * *

An owb prophet can transfer the power they gain from a Forsaken patron to those who worship them, effectively serving as a deity. Each owb prophet decides their own follower alignments, edicts, and anathema.
