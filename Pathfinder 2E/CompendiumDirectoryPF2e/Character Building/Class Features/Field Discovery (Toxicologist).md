You learn a special discovery depending on your field.

When using [[Class Features/Advanced Alchemy|Advanced Alchemy]] to make poisons during your daily preparations, you can spend one batch of [[Class Features/Infused Reagents|reagents]] to create three poisons in any combination, instead of just two of the same poison.
