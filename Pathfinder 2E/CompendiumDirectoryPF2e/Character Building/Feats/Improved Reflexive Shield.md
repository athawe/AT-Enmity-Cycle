# Improved Reflexive Shield
## Feat 16
### [[fighter]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Reflexive Shield
* * *
Your shield can help save nearby allies. When you use [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] against damage resulting from a Reflex save, adjacent allies who would take damage due to Reflex saves against the same effect also benefit from the damage reduction.
