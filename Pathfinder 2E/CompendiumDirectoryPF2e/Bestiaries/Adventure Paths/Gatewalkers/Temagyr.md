Temagyrs embody the fear of nocturnal hunters—predators that stalk through the dark of night and attack when their prey is most vulnerable. Able to blend in with and step between shadows to surprise victims, temagyrs delight in ambush tactics.

An average temagyr is 8 feet long and weighs 500 pounds but moves with unnatural fluidity and grace, the shadows they carry seeming to hang in the air behind them. In combat, a temagyr can take down opponents either with physical attacks or by taking bites out of their enemy's shadow. These shadow wounds, which remain visible unless healed, often perplex Material Plane doctors and investigators; a corpse from a temagyr attack can appear pristine, its tattered shadow the only clue to how it met its untimely fate.

Gorgas are fey embodiments of diurnal creatures' fear of the dark. Beings of shadow and hunger, they love to prey upon light-loving creatures. Many different kinds of gorgas exist, and each embodies a different facet of the night's countless terrors.

Gorgas are common in the First World realm of Nighthold, where they once served the mysterious Count Ranalc. After Ranalc's disappearance, the gorgas quickly lost what little compassion they had, scattered into small bands led by their strongest members, and began hunting any fey they could find. All gorgas carry shrouds of shadow within them, and most find daylight unpleasant, tending to remain within Nighthold's perpetual gloom or hole up in caverns or deep forests until night falls. Their bizarre eyes—hollow pools of magical shadow—allow them to see even in magical darkness.
