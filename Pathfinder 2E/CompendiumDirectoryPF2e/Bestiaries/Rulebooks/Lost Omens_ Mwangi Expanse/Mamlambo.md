Mamlambos are river predators with hypnotic, bioluminescent skin. They appear similar to crocodiles, but the narrow head at the end of their long necks resembles a horse's skull, and their four legs are stubby and inefficient for land movement. Their skin's green glow is only barely visible in daylight or when underwater, though the glow is difficult to resist. As a result, they're frequently trailed by fish, birds, or other river creatures ensnared by the alluring radiance.

Humanoids are mamlambos' favorite prey, particularly humans, although they strangely prefer to only eat their victims' faces and brains. Mamlambos are dim-witted but sly, and sometimes hide their victims under submerged rocks or logs to make their discovery less likely. A mamlambo might be active in a region for days or even weeks before its presence is discovered.
