These squat, rotund elementals have three legs, three arms, three eyes, and one massive maw, which they fill with the gems and metals they find so delicious.

Earth elementals make excellent bodyguards for adventuresome spelunkers and are ideal protectors of important subterranean locations such as vaults and treasuries.
