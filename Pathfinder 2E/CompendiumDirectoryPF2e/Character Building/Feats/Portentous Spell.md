# Portentous Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 16
### [[manipulate]][[mental]][[oracle]][[spellshape]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 




Your spellcasting is rife with strange lights, esoteric gestures, and other captivating effects that befuddle your foes.

If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell, any creature that attempts to use a reaction triggered by your Cast a Spell activity takes a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and skill checks rolled as part of the reaction.

In addition, if the spell includes a spell attack roll or requires a saving throw, creatures you hit or that fail their saves are [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] with you until the start of your next turn.
