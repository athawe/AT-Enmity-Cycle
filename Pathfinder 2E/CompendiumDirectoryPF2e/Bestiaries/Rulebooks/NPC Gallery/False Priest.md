Belief is perhaps the strongest force in the universe, driving many to great heights. Instilling a sense of belief and then using that belief against someone, however, is the discipline of a false priest. Combining their gifts of deception, a silver tongue, and an impeccable sense of timing, the false priest can gain influence among the powerful, entice a mark to dispose of all their possessions, and make a believer out of a cynic.

Those initiated into the hidden truths and forbidden secrets of the world are forever transformed-or so they claim. To the cynical, a mystic is nothing more than a charlatan or zealot. Others profess to sense an aura around such luminaries and treat them with reverence, lest they offend some harbinger of unspeakable doom.
