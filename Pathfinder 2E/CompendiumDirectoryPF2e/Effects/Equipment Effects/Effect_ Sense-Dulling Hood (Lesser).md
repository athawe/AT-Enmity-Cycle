# Effect: Sense-Dulling Hood (Lesser)
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Sense-Dulling Hood (Lesser)|Sense-Dulling Hood (Lesser)]]

The mask grants you a +2 item bonus to saving throws against auditory, olfactory, and visual effects. Since it dulls your senses without depriving you of them, the mask also imposes a â€“1 penalty to rolls and checks using Perception.
