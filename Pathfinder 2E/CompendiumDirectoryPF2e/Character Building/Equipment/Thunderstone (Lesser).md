When this stone hits a creature or a hard surface, it explodes with a deafening bang. A thunderstone deals the listed sonic damage and sonic splash damage, and each creature within 10 feet of the space in which the stone exploded must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude check saving throw with the listed DC or be [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] until the end of its next turn. Many types of thunderstone grant an item bonus to attack rolls.

The bomb deals 1d4 sonic damage and 1 sonic splash damage, and the DC is 17.
