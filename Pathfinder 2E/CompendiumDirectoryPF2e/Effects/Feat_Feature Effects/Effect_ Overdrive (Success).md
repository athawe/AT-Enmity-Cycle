# Effect: Overdrive (Success)
## Level 1
### 






Your gizmos go into overdrive, adding power to your attacks. Your Strikes deal additional damage equal to half your Intelligence modifier for 1 minute. After the Overdrive ends, your gizmos become unusable as they cool down or reset, and you can't use Overdrive for 1 minute.
