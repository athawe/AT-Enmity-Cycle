A fetch behemoth is much larger than a stalker, and forms from the soul of a Large fey or humanoid.

* * *

A fetch is a twisted, deviant simulacrum of a humanoid creature that exists or existed at one point on the Material Plane. Rumors of fetches that are reflections of entities from other planes persist, but none of these tales speak of fetches that duplicate anything other than a sapient source. A fetch can manifest spontaneously when a powerful creature undergoes a significant emotional event or dies, either while on the First World or while in an area significantly influenced by the First World, but one can also be created by significant forces like the Eldest in order to torment and vex those who have annoyed them. While a fetch manifests from a soul's "reflection," and as such bears a striking resemblance to that creature's appearance in life, a fetch has no true memories of its own. It keeps fragments of false remembrances from its source as if it experienced them in a half-remembered dream-which ensure the fetch is enraged by and jealous of its source.

A fetch is similar in appearance to the creature whose soul spawned it, save that it often displays fey-like features such as pointed ears, plantlike elements, or supernatural grace. A fetch who seeks to impersonate a stillliving source must disguise these features, and takes care to manifest its fetch weapon as one known to be wielded by its target.

When a fetch dies, it and its manifested items fades away into a bloom of plant life, its soul instantly recycled into the First World, leaving behind a patch of weeds and thorny flowers roughly in the shape they held in mockery while alive.
