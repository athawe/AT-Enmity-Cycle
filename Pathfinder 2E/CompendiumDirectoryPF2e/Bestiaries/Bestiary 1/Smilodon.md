Smilodons are large saber-toothed cats, apex predators that are significantly more muscular and broader than the other species of big cats. They often kill prey with a quick stab to the throat or other vulnerable spot. The smilodon's oversized fangs are particularly sought after as trophies.

Few predators of the natural world can match the cat's talent for stalking and stealth.
