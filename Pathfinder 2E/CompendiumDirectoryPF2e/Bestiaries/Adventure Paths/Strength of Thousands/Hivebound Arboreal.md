Non-arboreal creatures that enter the aura or start their turn within it take 7d8 piercing damage from the bites (DC 38 Fortitude check). If the hivebound arboreal fails a saving throw against an area effect, the biting ants die off, and the aura is deactivated until new ants swarm out at the end of the hivebound arboreal's next turn (or after 1 minute, if the hivebound arboreal critically fails it saving throw)."
