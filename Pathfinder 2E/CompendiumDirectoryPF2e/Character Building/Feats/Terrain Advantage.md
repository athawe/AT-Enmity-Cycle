# Terrain Advantage
## Feat 9
### [[lizardfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can take advantage of the terrain to bypass foes' defenses. Non-lizardfolk creatures in difficult terrain are [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to you. If you have a swim Speed, non-lizardfolk creatures that are in water and lack a swim Speed are also off-guard to you.
