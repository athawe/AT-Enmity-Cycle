# Keep Pace (Bounty Hunter) `pf2:r`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Bounty Hunter Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** Your prey is within reach and attempts to move away from you.

* * *

Your prey can't escape. Stride up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you've moved your full Speed.

You can use Keep Pace to [[Actions/Burrow|Burrow]], [[Actions/Climb|Climb]], [[Actions/Fly|Fly]], or [[Actions/Swim|Swim]] instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.
