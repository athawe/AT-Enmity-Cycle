At the end of their turn, they must save against Battlefield Command again to determine how the effect continues into their next turn, but each time this save is attempted the DC is reduced by 2."

Variant male onidoshi

Onidoshi, or ogre mages, are oni with the material form of an ogre. Onidoshi's supernatural prowess and overwhelming intellect are enough to awe and cow entire families of rank-and-file ogres. Because of this, onidoshi are often found at the head of ogre war parties or orchestrating these violent campaigns from behind the scenes. It's rare for onidoshi to lead solitary existences, but those who do prefer to maraud the countryside or exploit villages and hoard the spoils for themselves.
