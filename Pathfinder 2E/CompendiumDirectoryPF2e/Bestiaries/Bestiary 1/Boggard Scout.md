    desc: "  If the boggard scout hits a creature with its tongue, that creature becomes [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] by the boggard. Unlike with a normal grab, the creature isn't [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of the boggard's tongue.\n\nA creature can sever the tongue by hitting AC 13 and dealing at least 2 slashing damage. Though this doesn't deal any damage to the boggard, it prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week."

Often tasked with patrolling the borders of their lands, boggard scouts learn to speak another language (typically Common) to make it easier to issue threats and insults toward trespassers.

Boggards are aggressive humanoid amphibians that thrive in swamps, marshes, and even some rain forests. Boggards hatch from eggs into tadpoles, fiercely competing for food and even consuming their siblings in that struggle. Over 3 years, the surviving boggards develops arms, legs, and lungs while learning the rudiments of hunting, crafts, and warfare-everything needed to survive in their might-makes-right society. At the top of most boggard hierarchies lords a hulking swampseer imbued with sinister divine magic.
