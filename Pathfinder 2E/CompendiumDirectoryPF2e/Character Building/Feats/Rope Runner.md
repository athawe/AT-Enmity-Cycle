# Rope Runner
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Acrobatics; trained in Athletics; Pirate Dedication
* * *
You run and climb across ropes and rigging almost as easily as on the ground. You gain a [[Actions/Climb|Climb]] Speed of 15 feet, but only on ship's rigging or similar ropes.

Whenever you succeed at an Athletics check to Climb a rope or an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Balance|Balance]] on a rope, you get a critical success instead. You aren't [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] while Climbing or Balancing on a rope.
