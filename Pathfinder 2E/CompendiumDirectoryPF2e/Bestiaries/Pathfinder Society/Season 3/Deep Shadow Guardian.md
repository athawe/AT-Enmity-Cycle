    desc: "  Like normal objects, a shadow guardian has Hardness. This Hardness reduces any damage the guardian takes by an amount equal to the Hardness. Once a shadow guardian is reduced to fewer than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its construct armor breaks, removing the Hardness and reducing its Armor Class to 20 when broken."

  - name: "Disorienting Shadows"
    desc: " (occult,shadow) When a shadow guardian hits with its staff, a mote of shadow clings to the target. The target must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude check save or become [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 1]] and take a -1 status penalty to Perception checks involving sight as long as the mote remains. The target can use an Interact action to remove the mote. On a critical failure, the target must use two total Interact actions to remove the mote. Otherwise, the mote vanishes after 1 minute."

  - name: "Shadowcloak"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (illusion,occult,shadow) The shadow guardian becomes shrouded in shadows and becomes [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]]. As the nature of this effect leaves the guardian's location obvious, it can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until it is exposed to direct sunlight, whichever comes first."
