# Integrated Gauntlet
## Feat 7
### [[inventor]]

**Category** classfeature; 




**One-Handed Weapon Only; Can't Have the Two-Hand Trait**

* * *

Combining your weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can quickly switch between attacking with your weapon and tinkering using your hands. Your innovation gains the free-hand trait.
