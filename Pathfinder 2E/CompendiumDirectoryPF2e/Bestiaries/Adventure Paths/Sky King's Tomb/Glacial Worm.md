Cave worm eggs that lie dormant for a long period may experience significant climactic shift. If the temperature falls below freezing, the worms may hatch as glacial worms, also called white worms. These creatures immediately migrate as far north as possible, seeking the glaciers or icebergs that will nourish and house them. Glacial worms lack stingers, as liquid venom is less effective in cold temperatures. Occasionally, such creatures are carried far south on icebergs that have carved off the main ice sheets of the polar regions.
