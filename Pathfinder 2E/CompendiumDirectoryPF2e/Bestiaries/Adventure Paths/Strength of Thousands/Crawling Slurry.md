Acid damage can scar stone and reduce flesh to pitted chunks, but some organic compounds are resistant to acid and respond by combining into a mass of roiling, living slurry. These scarred clumps hunger to consume anything they can sense. They move with quick, darting contractions that surprise those used to facing slow-moving oozes.
