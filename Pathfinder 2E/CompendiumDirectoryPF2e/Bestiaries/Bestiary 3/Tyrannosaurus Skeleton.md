The creature takes 2d10 + 9 piercing damage (DC 28 Reflex check save). If the creature fails its save and is Medium or smaller, it's also impaled and stuck to the rib. It moves with the skeleton and takes 2d6 bleed until it either [[Actions/Escape|Escapes]] or someone uses [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] to break the rib (either is DC 28)."

A massive dinosaur predator makes for a fearsome skeleton.

Almost any creature that had bones in life and leaves them behind in death can become a shambling, undead skeleton-humanoids, beasts, aberrations, fey, and more.
