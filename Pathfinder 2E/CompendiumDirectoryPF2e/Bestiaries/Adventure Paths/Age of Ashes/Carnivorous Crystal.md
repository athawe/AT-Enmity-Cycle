    desc: "  Whenever the carnivorous crystal takes a critical hit from an attack that deals bludgeoning or sonic damage, or it critically fails its saving throw against an effect that deals bludgeoning or sonic damage, it might split. If the carnivorous crystal has at least 15 HP remaining after taking the damage, it splits into two identical crystals, each with half the original's Hit Points. When the carnivorous crystal splits, one crystal remains in the same space and the other appears in an adjacent unoccupied space. If no adjacent space is unoccupied, the crystal automatically pushes creatures out of the way to fill a space."

Carnivorous crystals are strange ooze creatures native to the Plane of Earth. Unlike most oozes, their bodies are not homogeneously fluid; rather, interspersed within their glassy, viscous resin are thousands of sharp mineral formations that nevertheless possess some of the same flexibility and mobility as the rest of the creature's gooey body.
