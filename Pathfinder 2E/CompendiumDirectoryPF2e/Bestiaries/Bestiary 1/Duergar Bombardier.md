Alchemy intrigues many duergars, and their cruel traditions often motivate them to experiment on slaves. Eager to inflict pain and justify the abuse as a method of expanding knowledge, duergar bombardiers often accompany slaver bands so they can have the first chance to select their next test subjects from captured victims. To duergar bombardiers, the lob of each bomb represents a new opportunity to observe how their targets react and record the results to enhance future modifications to their alchemical concoctions.

Deep beneath the surface, duergars stubbornly claim the ancestral subterranean homelands of the dwarves as their own, having refused to venture to the surface along with their modern dwarven cousins. An exiled dwarven deity named Droskar offered duergars salvation from the horrors of the Darklands, and in exchange duergars endlessly toil in his honor within their subterranean empire. Notorious slavers, duergars regularly raid other Darklands settlements as well as surface communities in constant search of living beings to task with endless amounts of work in their harsh and exhausting settlements.

Duergars are gray-skinned creatures, often referred to as 'ashen' by those surface dwarves willing to speak of them. These subterranean dwarves have a strong natural connection with cave-dwelling vermin, and it's common to see duergar caravans drawn by teams of immense beetles. Most duergars devote themselves to the worship of Droskar, a taskmaster of a god who demands back-breaking toil in addition to regular prayer. Duergar leadership often consists of powerful divine servants of Droskar, along with incredibly stout warriors whose martial prowess ensures they can overcome any direct threat to their rule. Almost every aspect of duergar society is controlled by a strict hierarchy of leadership, with taskmasters directing subordinates across all walks of life.
