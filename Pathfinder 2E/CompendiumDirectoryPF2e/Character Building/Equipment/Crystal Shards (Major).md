This flask holds a pressurized red-brown gas flecked with bits of sublimated crystal. You gain a +3 item bonus to attack rolls. When the bomb explodes, it deals 4d4 piercing damage and 6 piercing splash damage as the mixture suddenly turns into solid crystals flying at high speeds.

Surfaces in the splash area grow brittle, gleaming red crystals that crumble to dust after 1 minute. The crystals on level surfaces are [[Equipment/Caltrops|Caltrops]]. The crystals on vertical surfaces can be used briefly as handholds, granting the listed item bonus to the next Athletics check to [[Actions/Climb|Climb]] each space. The crystals in each space crumble after the creature leaves, whether Climbing or moving through the caltrops.
