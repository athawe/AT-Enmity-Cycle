## Feat 10
### [[stance]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wielding a [[Equipment/Buckler|Buckler]].

You spin your buckler defensively toward every attack. While you are in this stance, you constantly have your buckler raised as if you'd used [[Actions/Raise a Shield|Raise a Shield]], as long as you meet that action's requirements.
