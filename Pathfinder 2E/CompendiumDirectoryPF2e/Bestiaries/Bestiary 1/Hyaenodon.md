Hyaenodons are the ferocious primeval cousins of the smaller hyena. Looming, shaggy-furred creatures nearly the size of a horse, hyaenodons are truly formidable predators to be reckoned with, due both to their size and to their bone-crushing jaws. Gnoll clans find these creatures particularly useful as mounts and guardians.

Hyenas are pack-hunting scavengers known for their unnerving, laughter-like cries, and they aren't above supplementing their carrion diets with fresh prey.
