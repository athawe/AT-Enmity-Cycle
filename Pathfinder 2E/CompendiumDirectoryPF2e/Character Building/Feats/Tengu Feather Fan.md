# Tengu Feather Fan
## Feat 5
### [[tengu]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've learned to bind some of your feathers together into a fan to focus your ancestral magic. You gain a _tengu feather fan_: a magic item of light Bulk with a level equal to your level and the evocation and primal traits. You (and only you) can use the _tengu feather fan_ to cast tengu magic. If your fan is lost or destroyed, you can create a replacement during your daily preparations; if you do so, your previous fan falls apart into mundane feathers. Further feats might grant you additional activations of your _tengu feather fan_, but you can never have more than three activations per day, no matter how many such feats you have. The DC for spells you cast with your _tengu feather fan_ is your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. You can cast the 1st-rank [[Spells/Gust of Wind|Gust of Wind]] spell by activating your _tengu feather fan_. Fortitude saving throw

**Activate** Interact

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You cast one of the spells contained in your t_engu feather fan_. Activating the fan takes the spell's normal number of actions. You can also Activate the fan to cast a cantrip you've gained from a heritage or ancestry feat; this activation doesn't count against the fan's uses per day.
