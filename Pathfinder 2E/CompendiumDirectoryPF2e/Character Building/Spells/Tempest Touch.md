    desc: "Your touch calls forth a churning mass of icy water that clings to your target, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 1d4 cold damage. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target takes half damage and a -5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Failure** The target takes full damage and a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the target takes double damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The bludgeoning and cold damage each increase by 1d4."
