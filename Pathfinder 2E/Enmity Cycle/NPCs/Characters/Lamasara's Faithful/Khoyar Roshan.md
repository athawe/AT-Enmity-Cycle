### Appearance

tall and lean, dark hair, perhaps in his late forties. Cassock of highest quality black silk, with silver thread piping. Large silver ring, and silver spiral shaped holy symbol. His clean-shaven face was strong and proud, with the hooked Thuvian nose and darkly tanned skin, yet something in the way he held his lips—thin and tight—kept him from being truly handsome, giving him a somewhat effete, officious air.
