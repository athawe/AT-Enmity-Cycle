# Endemic Herbs
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Herbalist Dedication; trained in Survival
* * *
During your daily preparations, you find medicinal plants endemic to your location. Until your next preparations, you can spend an additional batch of herbs to add a benefit to an item you create with your herbalism.

The benefit of the special herbs affects the creature that the item is applied to; if the benefit is not immediate, it lasts for 1 minute unless otherwise stated. This adjustment counts as an additive, so you can't include another additive without spoiling the item.

*   **Aquatic** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves.
*   **Arctic** For 1 hour, treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less severe.
*   **Desert** For 1 hour, treat environmental heat effects as if they were one step less severe.
*   **Forest** Gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against disease and poison effects.
*   **Mountain** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves.
*   **Plains** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves.
*   **Swamp** Remove one source of persistent bleed damage.
*   **Underground** Gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception.
