# Mentor, Combat

### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Mentor\]\[Social\]**

**Prerequisites** Tier 1 with the Vigilant Seal

**Cost** 2 Fame

* * *

**Effect** While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you provide pointers and lead drills that ensure your newer colleagues' attacks strike true. For any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours, you increase the Level Bump's modifier to attack rolls and spell attack rolls to 2.

**Normal** A Level Bump increases a PC's attack roll and spell attack roll modifiers by 1.

**Special** A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.
