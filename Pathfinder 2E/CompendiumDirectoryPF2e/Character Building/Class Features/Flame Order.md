# Flame Order
## Feat 1
### [[druid]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You feel a kinship with flames and can use them for succor and destruction. You're trained in Acrobatics. You also gain the [[Feats/Fire Lung|Fire Lung]] druid feat. You gain the [[Spells/Wildfire|Wildfire]] order spell. Allowing unnatural fires to spread or preventing natural fires from occurring in a way that harms the environment are anathema to your order (this doesn't prevent you from using fire destructively or force you to combat a controlled or natural fire).
