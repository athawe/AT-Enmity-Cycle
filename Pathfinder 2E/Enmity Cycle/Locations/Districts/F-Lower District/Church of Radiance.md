Lamasara's Faithful LODGE MERCHANT MUNICIPAL TEMPLE 
A modest but well cared for church is joined to the hospital for all of Lamasara, stocked with healers and acolytes who tend to the needs of any who make their way through its doors.
Sarenraeâ€™s favored animals include the dove, the falcon, and the basking lizard. In the nations of the Golden Road, worshippers of the Dawnflower paint images of a lizard sunning itself on rocks or walls to create a miniature shrine.
