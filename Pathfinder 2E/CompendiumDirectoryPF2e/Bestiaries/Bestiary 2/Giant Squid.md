The giant squid then makes a beak Strike against one creature that it [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]] during Ravenous Embrace. Each arm Strike counts separately for the squid's multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until the squid has made all of its arm Strikes; the beak Strike uses the multiple attack penalty as normal."

Dwelling deep within the oceans, this huge cephalopod grows up to 45 feet in length and can weigh up to 600 pounds. Its arms and tentacles are lined with hundreds of hooks and suckers, allowing it to seize its prey with ease.
