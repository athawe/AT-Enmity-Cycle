Any creature within 30 feet of the victim must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude check save or become [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]] (plus [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] on a critical failure, for as long as it's sickened).\n\nWhile within the aura, affected creatures take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against disease and to recover from the sickened condition. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 minute. The victim of the disease doesn't roll a save, but takes the failure effects automatically and can't reduce its sickened value below 1 (1 day)."

The brutish and gluttonous augnagar live to feast- preferably on rotten flesh, and when possible, demon flesh. But to them, the greatest delicacy is the flesh of other augnagars. Augnagars have spiderlike legs with leathery membranes like a bat's wings, and three tails ending in hooked claws perfect for slicing flesh.
