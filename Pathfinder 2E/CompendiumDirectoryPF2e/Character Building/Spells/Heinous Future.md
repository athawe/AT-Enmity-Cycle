    desc: "You hold up a fractured mirror to the target, and in that mirror it sees a thing that may yet come to passâ€”a ghastly foretelling that the target instinctively knows is eerily possible. It's not a guaranteed thing, just a dreadful possibility, but it haunts the target's thoughts all the same.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The target is slowed 1 and stupefied 1 until it next gets eight hours of rest.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 2]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 2]], decreasing these conditions by 1 for each eight hours of rest it gets."
