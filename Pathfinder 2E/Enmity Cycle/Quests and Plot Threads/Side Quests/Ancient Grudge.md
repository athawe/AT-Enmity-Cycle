A curse inflicts a random child every generation causing it to transform into an aberrant beast upon its 16th birthday. The source of this is the ghost of a young man who was in line to be pharaoh 1000s of years ago. An artifact that his spirit has bonded with has been used as a decoration for ages. Perhaps his sword is used as part of a decorative sundial.
