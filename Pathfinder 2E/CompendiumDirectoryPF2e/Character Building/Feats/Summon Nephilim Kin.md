**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** any aasimar lineage feat

You have a connection to the celestial realms, allowing you to summon a celestial ally. Once per day, you can cast [[Spells/Summon Celestial|Summon Celestial]] as a 5th-rank divine innate spell, but the celestial summoned must be from the same category as your own lineage, such as a creature with the angel trait if you are angelkin.
