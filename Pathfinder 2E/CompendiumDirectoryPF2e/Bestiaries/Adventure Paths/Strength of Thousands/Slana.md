The rolling thunder before the rain provides the massive, leonine humanoids known as slanas with a tremendous power. These solitary and nomadic creatures primarily dwell in the jungles and savannas of the Mwangi Expanse, but they can range into nearby areas in search of prey or when drawn by strange primal forces only slanas can recognize. Slanas view each other as rivals who test each other's prowess, so when drawn together by this strange calling they nearly always fight to the death. A slana's roar echoes like thunder across the countryside, and denizens of the Mwangi fear a slana's approach whenever an oncoming storm's thunder seems more ferocious than its rain.
