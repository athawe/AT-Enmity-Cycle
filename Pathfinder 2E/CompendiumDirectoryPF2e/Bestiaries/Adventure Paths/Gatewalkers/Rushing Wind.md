    desc: "(1 action) The hazard uses its action to suck each creature (except the cairn wight) toward the aiudara. Each affected creature must attempt a DC 18 Fortitude check save.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is pulled 5 feet toward the aiudara and is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 1]]. If the creature is already adjacent to the aiudara, it doesn't move but is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 2]].\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is pulled 10 feet toward the aiudara, falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], and is stunned 1. If the creature is already adjacent to the aiudara, it doesn't move but falls prone and is stunned 2."
