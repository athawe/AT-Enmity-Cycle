If the party doesn't engage with these on time, just have assorted other people deal with them instead.
### [[21 In Pursuit of Water.pdf|In Pursuit of Water]] 
- level 1-4
- Ancient site called the Inspiriting Wellspring was used to access a subterranean waterway. 300 years ago, divs attacked it, killed most. The survivor fought them off and magically sealed an [[Aghash]] div inside the place. Usij cultists have been working the last decade to free it. They have 2 of the 3 keys they need. 
- After becoming well known with Lamasara's Faithful, this quest could be given to the party. Replace Prince Zinlo with Queen Zamere and proceed, using a distant ruin location.
- Might need a little levelling, and ignore the travel content
