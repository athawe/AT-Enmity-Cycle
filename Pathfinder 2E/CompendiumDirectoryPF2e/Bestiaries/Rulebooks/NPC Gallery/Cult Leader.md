    desc: "`pf2:3` (auditory,concentrate,emotion,linguistic,mental) With a short emotional phrase, the cult leader tries to sway the public to do their bidding. The cult leader tries to convince up to four bystanders in a crowd to either cause a commotion, turn against a person or group, leave the area, protect the cult leader, or calm down.\n\nThe cult leader attempts a single Deception check against the highest Perception DC among the targets.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The targets believe the lie and act as directed for 1 minute. Additionally, one bystander remains by the cult leader's side, influenced enough to join their sect.\n\nAll other targets become wise to the cult leader after 1 minute, at which point their attitude toward the leader worsens by one step.\n\n**Success** As a critical success, but no bystander joins the sect permanently.\n\n**Critical Failure** The crowd is unmoved and unamused, and their attitude toward the cult leader worsens by one step."

A career of mystical accomplishments combined with a lifetime of subterfuge and intimidation has elevated this occultist to a powerful position.

Those initiated into the hidden truths and forbidden secrets of the world are forever transformed-or so they claim. To the cynical, a mystic is nothing more than a charlatan or zealot. Others profess to sense an aura around such luminaries and treat them with reverence, lest they offend some harbinger of unspeakable doom.
