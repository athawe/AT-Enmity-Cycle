# Effect: Glittering Snare (Critical Failure)
## Level 4
### 






The creature takes a -4 status penalty to Stealth checks for 5 minutes or until it spends a 3-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to remove the glitter. The glitter continues to fall around the creature until completely removed, leaving a trail behind it as it moves and revealing its rough location; the creature is [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]], rather than [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]], to any creature that can see the glitter whenever it would otherwise have been undetected.
