    desc: "  The chyzaedu wears an eerie, alien layer of shimmering violet mucus that slithers and crawls over its flesh, but is hard as iron to the touch.\n\nIf a chyzaedu takes bludgeoning damage from a critical hit, its alien vestment is shatteredâ€”this reduces its AC to 27 and causes it to lose its resistance to mental and physical damage; it can grow a new alien vestment by concentrating for 1 hour."

    desc: " (aura,emotion,incapacitation,mental,occult) 30 feet. A chyzaedu gains sustenance by feeding upon the metabolisms of organic victims. A living creature that ends its turn in the aura must attempt a DC 27 Will check save.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected and is temporarily immune for 24 hours.\n\n**Success** The creature suffers a painful hunger pang, becoming [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** If possible, the creature spends its first 2 actions on its next turn eating or drinking (or spending actions to procure food or drink from its possessions or the surroundings, if necessary). The creature won't consume anything dangerous, but will eat things it normally has no appetite for.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature will eat or drink dangerous consumables, such as poison or rotten food, if other food or drink are not immediately available. The creature must spend its first 2 actions each round consuming for as long as it remains in the chyzaedu's aura plus 1 minute thereafter, but the creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn each round to end the effect early.\n* * *\n\n_Note: A DC was not provided for this ability by Paizo. The DC present here is a moderate DC for the creature level according to the Gamemastery Guide creature building Tables._"

Chyzaedus' home world was consumed millennia ago by the Dominion of the Black via the manipulation of a black hole. Rather than accept destruction or fight back, the chyzaedus instead joined forces with their destroyers, seeing in them a greater purpose than mere world domination. Today, chyzaedus serve in a role akin to a priesthood for the Dominion and take a sinister interest in bringing their beliefs to new worlds, teaching ignorant dwellers the glory of pure entropic destruction. Much like the black holes they venerate, chyzaedus possess an eternal hunger for sustenance and knowledge alike-they can never be sated by either, yet they will never starve as long as there are mortals whose energy they can feed upon.
