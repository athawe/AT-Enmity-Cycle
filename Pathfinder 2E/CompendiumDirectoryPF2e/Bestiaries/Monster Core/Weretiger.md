These ferocious werecreatures stalk prey with the cunning and skill of a true apex predator. Weretigers typically view all life as a potential meal. Powerful nocturnal hunters with excellent senses that help them ambush prey, weretigers are adaptable to an extreme range of environments. However, weretigers living in densely populated cities (potentially as courtesans, assassins, or guild leaders) often struggle to suppress their killer instincts, becoming overwhelmed by the urge to hunt.

Werecreatures are humanoids doomed to transform into animals and animalhumanoid hybrids under the light of the full moon. These shapechanging creatures are the result of an ancient primal curse that they can, in turn, transmit through their own bites. Their ability to lurk unseen in the wilds as well as among people, combined with the contagiousness of their condition, makes werecreatures a perennial cause of panicked suspicion.
