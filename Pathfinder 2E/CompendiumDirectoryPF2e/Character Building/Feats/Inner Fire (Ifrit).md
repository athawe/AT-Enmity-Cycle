# Inner Fire (Ifrit)
## Feat 1
### [[naari]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can call the fire inside you into the palm of your hand. You can cast the [[Spells/Produce Flame|Produce Flame]] cantrip as an innate primal or arcane spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
