# Subtle Delivery
## Feat 1
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You can capably deliver toxins with a [[Equipment/Blowgun|Blowgun]]. Your blowgun [[Actions/Strike|Strikes]] can apply injury poisons even if they deal no damage due to a creature's resistance.

If you critically succeed at an attack roll using a blowgun loaded with a dart you've poisoned and the target rolls a failure on the poison's initial save, the target critically fails instead.
