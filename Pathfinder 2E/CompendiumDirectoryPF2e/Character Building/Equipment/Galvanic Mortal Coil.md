# Galvanic Mortal Coil
## Item 10
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[magical]]


**Price** 970 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This porous steel coil wraps around a shard of onyx, supplementing the closely guarded science of galvaspheres with the magic of necromancy. When embedded in a body comprised of flesh, the blood and other fluids catalyze electrical pulses within the coil, activating the necromantic energies. In living creatures, this causes a dangerous surge that can damage the heart. In corpses, however, this can create a limited window of reanimation, with access to the corpse's final memories. _Galvanic mortal coils_ are even rarer than other galvaspheres, and thought by most to be merely hypothetical.
