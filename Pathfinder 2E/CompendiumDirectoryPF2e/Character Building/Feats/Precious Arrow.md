# Precious Arrow `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]][[magical]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Eldritch Archer Dedication
* * *
You enchant a piece of ammunition with the magical essence of a precious material, allowing you to leverage certain creatures' weaknesses.

Choose cold iron or silver; if you shoot the arrow before the end of your turn, it counts as that material. At 14th level, add adamantine to the list of materials you can choose from.
