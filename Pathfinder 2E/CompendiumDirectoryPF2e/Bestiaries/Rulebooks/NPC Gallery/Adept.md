Adepts have unlocked only the most minor occult mysteries of the universe. A few are chosen by accomplished practitioners for further training. Others volunteer to join a cabal by passing an initiation ritual.

* * *

Those initiated into the hidden truths and forbidden secrets of the world are forever transformed-or so they claim. To the cynical, a mystic is nothing more than a charlatan or zealot. Others profess to sense an aura around such luminaries and treat them with reverence, lest they offend some harbinger of unspeakable doom.
