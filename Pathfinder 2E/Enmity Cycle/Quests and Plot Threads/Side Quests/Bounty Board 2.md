Bounty board mission for bringing someone to justice 
- The message is written as if it's about someone from Water Lord territory, but it's about someone who was raped. She's rich and of means and would be humiliated if the news got out. She can describe some of the magic and how [[Indrajit]] shifted shapes multiple times after clawing into her memories.
- Try to get a little bit of emotion out of them here, emphasize how powerful the being is, and drop the word hero. Have her break down crying.
