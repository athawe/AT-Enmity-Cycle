The mischievous dragon sprites known as draxies have dueled their pixie cousins for the title of ultimate prankster for centuries. Possessed of draconic features and brilliant colorations, draxies descend from a mighty faerie dragon, reincarnated into multiple draxies after her death in the mercurial fashion of the fey realm. Draxies exercise patience and planning to create the perfect pranks, spending months, or even years, on their efforts.

Tiny winged fey with intense curiosity and adventurous spirits, sprites often find themselves in risky situations and shenanigans belying their stature. While their pixie and grig cousins are most common, numerous additional types of sprites were born from the faerie realm of the First World. These include draxies, melixies, and nykteras, each of which shares commonalities with a different animal or magical creature.
