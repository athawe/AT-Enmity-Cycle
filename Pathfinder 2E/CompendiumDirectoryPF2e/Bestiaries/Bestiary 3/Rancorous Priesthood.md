Followers of Rovagug must usually conceal their devotion to the Rough Beast, hiding in remote cave complexes or abandoned ruins; but they emerge from these strongholds when they sense weakness, gathering together into a destructive, homicidal mob to hunt down high-ranking priests of rival deities or slaughter entire towns. Alternatively, if their hidden bolthole is compromised, a mob of Rovagug's faithful might emerge-not hoping to save themselves, but intent only on taking their enemies with them as they die.
