# Witch Gnoll

### 






You're a shaggy, dark-furred gnoll capable of making some truly uncanny sounds. You can cast the [[Spells/Ghost Sound|Ghost Sound]] cantrip as an occult innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Impersonate and Create a Diversion when using only your voice.
