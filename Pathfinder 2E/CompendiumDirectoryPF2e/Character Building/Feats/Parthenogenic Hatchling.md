# Parthenogenic Hatchling
## Feat 1
### [[lizardfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You were hatched from an unfertilized egg during hard times for your people, and you are a biological copy of your mother.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases. Each of your successful saving throws against a disease reduces its stage by 2, or by 1 for a virulent disease. Each critical success against an ongoing disease reduces its stage by 3, or by 2 for a virulent disease.

You take damage only every 2 hours from thirst and every 2 days from starvation, rather than every hour and every day.
