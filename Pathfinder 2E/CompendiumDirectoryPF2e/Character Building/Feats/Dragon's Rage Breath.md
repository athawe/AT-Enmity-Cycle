## Feat 6
### [[arcane]][[barbarian]][[concentrate]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** dragon instinct
* * *
**Requirements** You haven't used this ability since you last Raged

* * *

You breathe deeply and exhale powerful energy in a 30-foot cone or 60-foot line, dealing 1d6 damage per level. The area and damage type match those of your dragon (see [[Class Features/Dragon Instinct|Table 3-4]]).

If you used this ability in the last hour, the area and the damage are halved (15-foot cone or 30-foot line; 1d6 damage for every 2 levels).

Each creature in the area must attempt a Reflex check save.
