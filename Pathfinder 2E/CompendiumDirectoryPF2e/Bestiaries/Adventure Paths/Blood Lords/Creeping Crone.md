Hags are neither immortal nor unageing; if not slain by an enemy, a hag eventually succumbs to old age. A hag who dies in agony or rage can rise again as a witchfire, while those who die of old age might rise again as an undead creature known as a creeping crone. A creeping crone has lost far more than her life; they can't form or join covens, denying them one of a living hag's most distinguishing abilities. This inability, more than their rotting bodies or hunger for flesh, makes creeping crones exiled among their former kin.
