# Reckless Abandon (Barbarian) `pf2:0`
## Feat 16
### [[barbarian]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** Your turn begins, and you are at half or fewer Hit Points.

* * *

Your blood boils when you take a beating, and you throw caution to the wind to finish the fight. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls, a -2 penalty to AC, and a -1 penalty to saves. These bonuses and penalties last until your Rage ends or until you are above half Hit Points, whichever comes first.
