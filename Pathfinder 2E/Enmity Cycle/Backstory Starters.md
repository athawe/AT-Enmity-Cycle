- Provide players with backstory starters that give them: 
	- 1 NPC ally (known or unknown?), enemy or a rival, or mentor
	- a connection to a certain faction or industry in Thuvia 
	- a personal item. Possibly a relic, but maybe I'll find other things that are suitable.
	- the [[Additional Lore]] feat on a relevant lore skill.
- To round out your character, please answer the following:
	- What is a reasonable (ie. level-appropriate) personal goal that you have?
	- What are the values & ideals that you care about the most?
	- How and why did you join the party?
	- How long have you been a member of the party? Were you adventuring before that?
	- Who are you closest to in the party? Why? What about outside of the party?

### Backstory Starter 1 - Daniel

- (Ally) You've known ? for at least the last decade that you've spent in Lamasara. He's a "insert job here" in "insert faction or business here". At some point, you helped him out with something major that he's never forgotten the debt for. What did you do?
- (Merchant) While most eschew the people who handle the raw textiles, you know the skill that high-thread count fabrics and other such products take to produce with speed and consistency. Being around the production of such has given you a detailed grasp of the organization structures of the businesses that handle the whole industry. This interest in the material factors that make great works possible, and the economic forces that pull the strings behind them has granted you the Additional Lore feat in *Mercantile Lore*. (At level 3 this would have risen from trained to expert as per the feat)
- (Fear) Every year, during the month of Erastus, you struggle to sleep due to awful nightmares. (sensitive to ghosts)

- Certain art fanatics and financiers make connections throughout the city to find out about the most impressive upcoming creations. You've been in contact with a few such wealthy people from either Deyad's Group or Kylas' Group. How long have you known them, and how well?
