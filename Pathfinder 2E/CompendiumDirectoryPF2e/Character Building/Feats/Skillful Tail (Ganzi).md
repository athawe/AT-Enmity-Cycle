# Skillful Tail (Ganzi)
## Feat 5
### [[ganzi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have a tail or similar body part that is always willing to lend a hand (so to speak).

You can perform simple [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] actions with your tail, such as opening an unlocked door. Your tail can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can't use it to hold items.
