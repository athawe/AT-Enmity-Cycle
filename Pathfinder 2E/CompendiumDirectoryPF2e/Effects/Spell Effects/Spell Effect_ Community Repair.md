# Spell Effect: Community Repair
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Community Repair|Community Repair]]

**Critical Success** The public work is restored to its prior construction, and it takes on further qualities, encouraged by the thoughts of the community. For the next week, while a caster is within 60 feet of the site of the ritual, they receive a +1 status bonus to Will saves against emotion effects and a +10-foot status bonus to their Speeds.

**Critical Failure** The public work refuses to repair itself, and the memories of the community members are soured in response to the botched ritual. For the next week, while a caster is within 60 feet of the site of the ritual, they cannot receive any benefit from beneficial emotion effects, and they take a -10-foot status penalty to their Speeds as their movement slows to a morose crawl.
