    desc: " (divine) A living humanoid killed by a wight commander's weapon or claw Strike rises as a wight of the commander's level or lower, most often a hunter wight or prowler wight, after 1d4 rounds. This spawn is under the command of the wight commander that killed them. They don't have drain life or spawn wight soldier and are [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 2]] for as long as they're a wight spawn. If the creator of the wight spawn dies, the wight spawn becomes a fully autonomous wight; they regain their free will, gain drain life and spawn wight soldier, and are no longer clumsy."

When the beloved leader of a military unit is raised as a wight, sometimes the spirits of their comrades return with them, creating a gestalt being of impeccable tactical acumen.

Wights are undead beings of spite who primarily stalk places related to death.
