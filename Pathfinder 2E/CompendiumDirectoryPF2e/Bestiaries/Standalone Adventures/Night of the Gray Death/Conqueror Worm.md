    desc: "  The conqueror worm is under the effects of 9th-rank [[Spells/Air Walk|Air Walk]] at all times."

  - name: "Convincing Telepathy"
    desc: " (mental,occult) When a conqueror worm communicates telepathically, its overwhelming will bolsters its lies. Its Deception checks and Deception DCs aren't penalized for elaborate or unbelievable telepathic lies."

  - name: "Mental Invader"
    desc: "`pf2:r` (mental,occult) **Trigger** A creature communicates telepathically with the conqueror worm (even to respond to the conqueror worm's telepathy or through a mental spell like [[Spells/Sending|Sending]]) or fails a saving throw against a mental spell cast by the conqueror worm\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The conqueror worm infects the mind of the creature, allowing it to mentally contact the creature from afar. The creature must attempt a DC 48 Will check saving throw and is temporarily immune for 1 year.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and can't be affected by the conqueror worm's Mental Invader ever again.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] for 1 minute.\n\n**Failure** As success, and the conqueror worm can target the creature with telepathy and mental spells regardless of distance, so long as the worm and target are on the same plane. This bond is permanent and can be broken only by [[Spells/Miracle|Miracle]], [[Spells/Wish|Wish]], or similar magic. The conqueror worm can maintain a maximum of 10 connections with Mental Invader. If another creature would be infected, the worm must choose to one of its existing connections end, or if the worm prefers to keep its current 10 connections, the new creature isn't infected instead.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, and for as long as the mental link lasts, the target uses an outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw against mental spells cast by the conqueror worm."

  - name: "Telepathic Escape"
    desc: " (incapacitation,mental,occult,possession) When the conqueror worm dies, it telepathically projects its consciousness into a creature infected by its Mental Invader ability and who is on the same plane as the conqueror worm. The creature must succeed at a DC 48 Will check save or it is overtaken by the conqueror worm. This has the same effect as the [[Spells/Possession|Possession]] spell with an unlimited duration, except the conqueror worm has wholly foregone its physical body. A host body possessed by a conqueror worm undergoes terrible changes. Every day, the host must succeed at a DC 48 Will check or become permanently [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] (or increase its stupefied value by 1) and increasingly pale, balding, and bloated. When the host reaches stupefied 4, an ectoplasmic cocoon forms around it. Over the next 24 hours, the host undergoes a swift metamorphosis and emerges as a new conqueror worm with all the memories of its previous incarnation. At this point, the host is dead and can't be restored except by [[Spells/Miracle|Miracle]], [[Spells/Wish|Wish]], or similar magic. Before that point, however, this horrid transformation can be ended by any effect that expels the conqueror worm's possession, meaning would be slayers of a conqueror worm had best locate its consciousness and end the possession before it's too late and the worm rises again."
