Variant terra-cotta soldier garrison

Terra-cotta warriors guard the tombs of ancient rulers, where they stand vigil, animating only when intruders break in to pilfer riches or defile the tomb itself. Each warrior is meticulously crafted from clay and given unique features.

* * *

These constructed warriors can work together as a trained group to repel intruders.
