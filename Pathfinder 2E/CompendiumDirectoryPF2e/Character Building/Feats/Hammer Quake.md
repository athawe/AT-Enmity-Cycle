# Hammer Quake `pf2:3`
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mauler Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** You're wielding a non-finesse melee weapon in two hands.

* * *

You smash the ground with your weapon, knocking nearby creatures to the ground.

Choose a square within your reach, including your own space. If there's a foe in the chosen square, Strike that foe with the required weapon. Then attempt to [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] every foe in the chosen square plus each square adjacent to that square, ignoring Trip's requirement that you have a hand free. This counts as three attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made the Strike, if any, and all the Trip attempts.
