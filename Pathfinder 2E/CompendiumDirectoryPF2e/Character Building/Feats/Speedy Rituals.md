# Speedy Rituals
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Efficient Rituals
* * *
You can perform rituals in only a fraction of the usual time. If a ritual has a casting time measured in days, you can cast it in an equal number of hours. If this results in a ritual longer than 8 hours, you split the ritual between multiple days, as normal for a ritual.
