    desc: "You strike mention of a specific name from one or more documents. When you cast the spell, give one proper name, be it a creature, location, or object. Any mention of that name within the document becomes blurred, smudged, or otherwise completely illegible. Epithets and unambiguous references to the name are redacted as well; for instance, redacting the name of the goddess [[Deities/Sarenrae|Sarenrae]] from a book would also remove references to her title \"the Dawnflower.\"\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (3rd)** Instead of striking out a given name, you can replace it with a different name you choose. Epithets and references are substituted with similar ones relating to the replacement name. Anyone reading the text can attempt a Perception or Society check against your spell DC to notice the altered text, though that doesn't tell them what the original said.\n\n**Heightened (4th)** At your choice, the duration is unlimited."
