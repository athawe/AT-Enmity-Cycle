With knowledge that the artists are imprisoned in the composer’s house, the PCs can proceed to that location at any time. Sefalia’s home is on the northwestern side of Lamasara, just outside the city. The property around the home has become overgrown with weeds, and there are numerous signs the place has not been well maintained. 
## The Composer’s House 
Sefalia’s success allowed her to purchase and then renovate an old estate that had been on the verge of being demolished. When she saw it, she immediately fell in love with the traditional Thuvian architecture and knew the structure had tremendous potential. Its location on the outskirts of the city were perfect for her needs—remote enough that practicing her music at all hours wouldn’t bother any neighbors, yet close enough to make it a quick stop for any local or traveling musicians to visit for the day. 
The building was originally the home of a wealthy merchant who had no family to inherit his property. When he died a few years ago, the house and surrounding land became entangled in legal proceedings. Because of her prestige, connections, and influence in Lamasara, Sefalia was able to cut through the red tape and purchase the home for a low cost. She hired a small staff to help run the household and entertain her frequent guests, including Valls and Dhia. The three would lounge about discussing favorite artists and their works, the state of the world, and the role of the arts in society. They came from different backgrounds, but they all had the same love in their hearts for their profession and their nation. They wanted to build something together to show how the five city-states of Thuvia were whole, and that their diversity was their strength. It was during dinner over one of these long weekends that the idea for the anbarit first came up. Each was immediately intrigued and set to work. 
Now the house serves as a prison. The three artists have been working under terrible conditions and are constantly plagued by nightmares of Zridi’s design. Although they don’t know Zridi is a pairaka, they do know she is the source of their torment and the reason they’re being forced to transform their beautiful message of unity into one of fear and hatred. 
The map for this location appears on the front inside cover. 
### E1. ENTRY AND FOUNTAIN MODERATE 6
==A cobblestone path wraps around a dry fountain in the center of several withered palm trees. There’s a sculpture of two musicians in the middle of the fountain. One figure stands and plays the ney, a long flutelike instrument, while the other is seated and appears to be singing while playing a stringed oud. The path continues to a large, stately building of traditional and expensive Thuvian design. The building’s central dome glitters with flakes of gold, hinting at a glorious past, while the chipped and peeling paint reveal a less spectacular present.==
**Creature**: One of the earliest successes in Zridi’s plan came when an early version of the corrupted anbarit twisted one of the composer’s prized trees into a terrifying monster. No longer simply a date palm tree, the scythe tree stands in its old spot east of the fountain, longing for victims it can consume. It patiently waits to attack until either a lone creature approaches or someone in a group is left trailing behind. Fueled by hatred and animosity for the living, it fights to the death. 

#### ELITE SCYTHE PALM CREATURE 7 
HUGE CHAOTIC EVIL PLANT

**Language** Aklo, Arboreal, Fey
**Skills** Athletics: +17, Stealth: +14 (+16 in forests)

**Effect** The scythe tree Strides up to 25 feet toward the triggering creature. Once the creature is in reach, the scythe tree makes a scythe branch Strike against it. The creature is *Off-Guard* against this Strike.

**Treasure**: Embedded in the tree’s trunk is a *grim trophy* and a pouch containing 95 gp. 

### E2. DATE GROVES LOW 6 
==Orderly rows of date palms grow to the east and west of the house, their fronds brown and withered.== 
Sefalia eventually planned to nurse these trees back to health but decided to focus on restoring the house first. Zridi’s arrival, of course, meant the trees continued to be neglected. These date trees once produced enough fruit to support the household, but if they’re not watered in the next week or two, they will likely die. Characters who *Search* the area with the tree nearest E7 and succeed at a *DC 22 Perception check* spot a scattered pile of red stained glass under the tree. A critical success reveals the smaller dome atop E7 has stained glass windows, several of which have broken sections. 
**Creatures**: Zridi stationed the two most powerful sand wolves here as guardians. They spend most of their time on the eastern side of the building, however, since they are nervous about the scythe tree. 

#### ELITE [[Sand Wolf]] (2) CREATURE 6 
UNCOMMON LARGE AIR BEAST EARTH
**Perception** +16; Low-Light Vision, Tremorsense (Imprecise) 30 Feet
**Language** Petran, Sussuran; (can't speak any language)
**Skills** Athletics: +14, Performance: +15, Stealth: +13 (+15 in deserts), Survival: +14

**Success** The target is Stupefied 1. 
**Failure** The target is Stupefied 2. 
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the target is Slowed 1.

### E3. ACOUSTIC DOME MODERATE 6 
==Elegant pillars support marble arches in this domed chamber. Colorful mosaics, faded with time and caked with grime, cover the walls. A section of the mosaics to the north has recently been cleaned and gleams brightly. The dome’s geometric patterns weave together to form a breathtaking array of shapes and designs. Numerous windows in the dome allow both air and light into the room.==
The central dome of the house is the feature that inspired Sefalia to purchase the place. The design is simple yet visually beautiful, and its acoustics are breathtaking. A musician who performs in the center of the chamber finds their work amplified and intensified in clarity and tone. *All music-based Performance checks here have their DCs reduced by 5*. The first pieces of the original, uncorrupted The Amity Cycle began here following a dinner party Sefalia hosted with Dhia and Valls. 
**Hazard**: The acoustics of the room are also why Zridi chose this place as her headquarters. She found the anbarit’s musical portions were particularly effective here, and as she experimented with different ways to corrupt the work, she discovered those revisions were just as powerful. After so many tests, the corrupted draft of the anbarit that she calls The Enmity Cycle infected the room and effectively became a magical trap. Its power is more focused than the final version due to repeated performances and the room’s acoustics. 
Fortunately, it’s possible for the PCs to disarm the hazard as it begins as long as they have the mechanical head with them and have successfully found and repaired the recording device. The mechanical head can automatically disable the hazard by reciting the pieces of The Amity Cycle it knows. This happens on initiative count 10 after the hazard is triggered. If the hazard is detected before it activates, the head can also automatically prevent the hazard from beginning. 
#### CORRUPTED DRAFT 
HAZARD 8 UNIQUE COMPLEX CURSE MECHANICAL TRAP 
**Stealth** +16 (expert) or detect magic 
**Description** Discordant music, dance, and poetry combine to build a deep suspicion and distrust of strangers. 
**Disable** *Performance DC 28* to counteract the performance or *Religion or Occult DC 28* to disrupt the spiritual energy. Two total successes are needed to disable the trap. The mechanical head can automatically disable the trap with two uses of Inspired Recitation. 
**Sickening Performance** `pf2:r` (emotion, mental, occult) **Trigger** Two or more characters enter area E3 and make any sound at all; **Effect** Sounds or speech are amplified and garbled into a terrible, shrieking cry. All creatures in the area take 2d10+11 mental damage (*DC 28 basic Will save*). The trap then rolls initiative. 
**Routine** (1 action; emotion, fear, mental, occult) The echoes continue to reverberate, tearing at those in the area and filling them with distrust of others. All creatures in the area take 2d10+11 mental damage and must attempt a *DC 28 Will save*. 
**Critical Success** The target is unaffected and is immune to the effects for 1 minute. 
**Success** The target takes half damage. 
**Failure** The target takes full damage and is sickened 1 by feelings of distrust and anxiety. 
**Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is sickened 2. 
**Reset** The hazard stops when there are no conscious creatures in area E3 and resets after 1 minute. 

> [!NOTE] IF ZRIDI LEARNS OF THE INVESTIGATION
> It’s possible Zridi learns the PCs are working to unravel her plot during this chapter (or even before), most likely if Seddek escapes and returns to her hideout at the Riversong Theater. If this comes to pass, Zridi can use her shapechanging abilities to follow the PCs in another form, such as a mangy street dog, and watch or thwart their progress. She can also summon a [[Doru]] div and use that creature’s obsession with secrets to investigate her investigators without having to bother with it herself. In any case, if she learns the PCs have rescued the artists, she dispatches the animate dream (see area F3) to harass them, drive them off course, and slow their progress.

### E4. LIVING QUARTERS 
==This well-appointed room has walls draped with intricate tapestries that have been shredded into ribbons. A canopied bed and several pillows have similarly been cut to pieces, and white feathers cover the floor in piles.==
This was originally Sefalia’s room before Zridi arrived. The door to the east leads to a washroom. 
**Treasure**: A character who *Searches* the room finds a moderate *mistform elixir* and a moderate *antidote* that rolled under the bed. 

### E5. PARLOR 
==The patchy walls of this room look as if they’ve recently been scraped of their peeling paint. A low, round table is shoved against the western wall and bears numerous scratches and burns.==
Sefalia often greeted and hosted guests here, and this is where the three partners would talk, lounge, and take small meals. The table used to be in another room, but after the estate’s current occupants damaged it during an enthusiastic game of cards, they shoved it here. 

### E6. RIAD 
==Blue and white tiles cover the floor of this room in a mosaic and are cool to the touch. The lower halves of the whitewashed plaster walls are covered in similar tiles with geometric designs in green and white. Four thick rose bushes grow near a softly burbling fountain in the center of the room, and a pleasant coolness fills the entire chamber in stark contrast to the heat outside.== 
Like many of the fancier homes in Thuvia, this house boasts a private riad where the temperatures are kept refreshingly low through use of materials, water, and airflow. When the rose bushes are in bloom, their scent flows through this room and beyond. Zridi and her minions have so far refrained from damaging the room and often use it as a retreat. 
**Treasure**: A character who *Searches* the room finds a *jade serpent wondrous figurine* in the pool. 

### E7. DINING HALL MODERATE 6 
==Carved marble pillars stand to the east and west of this impressive dining hall. Tiled mosaics cover the ceiling up to a low dome, which is bare white. High up on the walls are a series of stained glass windows of yellows and oranges. A few panes of each window have been smashed out. 
Tables shoved up against the north wall are covered in papers, some torn in half, others ripped to shreds. The inkwell on the table has been spilled, blackening several other pages, while balls of crumpled paper are scattered about the floor. A set of iron manacles with a long chain is attached to the northern wall.== 
The original owner of the house built this room to entertain guests, and Sefalia used it for just that purpose until Zridi and her followers arrived. The musician has since spent most of her waking hours as a captive in this room, chained to the table and working to complete the task the div has set her. 
The secret door to the east leading to E8, used by house staff to deliver meals from the kitchen, is cleverly disguised by the mosaic tile on the wall. A PC who *Searches* and succeeds at a *DC 22 Perception check* spots the door and the recessed handle used to open it. 
Characters who *Investigate* the room and succeed at a *DC 22 Society or Music Lore check* realize the papers are drafts of sheet music written by someone who knows what they’re doing. A critical success reveals both the similarities of the music to the song from the music box the characters collected in the tinkerer’s house as well as the stylistic markings of the composer Sefalia. 
Characters who *Search* the room and succeed at a *DC 22 Perception check* can see little fragments of red stained glass in the windows, with the other colors untouched. Repulsed by the color, one of the first tasks Zridi set for Seddek was smashing all the red glass and disposing of it. 
**Creatures**: Knowing she needed help to pull off her plan, Zridi turned to the sinister circles she worked with and called in some favors. A few years ago, on one of her sojourns to the House of Oblivion, she made the acquaintance of a strange pair of vulpinals newly arrived at the horrid place. The twins, Kyem and Daleesha, were captured near Merab by a sepid div and dragged to the House of Oblivion to be broken of their gregarious ways. It took a month of manipulation and a powerful ritual, but the twins emerged corrupted. No longer did they yearn for lively jigs and carousing carols; now the twins only play discordant dirges and scheme for destruction.
Zridi was immediately intrigued by the pair, and as soon as they were allowed to roam the halls on their own, she cozied up to them with manipulative charm. The twins were susceptible to suggestion in their still-dazed state, and the trio quickly became fast friends. 
The three hadn’t seen each other for nearly a year when Zridi tracked them down and asked for their help. She’s tasked Kyem and Daleesha with writing the music for the corrupted anbarit. They’re stationed here to keep anyone from entering the hallway to the east. When Sefalia is here doing her work, they serve as both guards and collaborators. Although they’re vicious and cruel, their musical skills remain uncorrupted, and they have been helpful in doing the work. 
In combat, the vulpinals coordinate their attacks and try to avoid melee. Utterly brainwashed by nihilistic evil, they *fight to the death*.

#### KYEM AND DALEESHA CREATURE 6

**Divine Innate Spells** *DC 24*; **4th** dimension door, divine wrath; **3rd** agonizing despair, blindness, sound burst; **2nd** deafness, detect alignment (at will; good only), invisibility (at will; self only); **Constant** (5th) speak with animals, tongues 
**Champion Focus Spell** *DC 24*, 1 Focus Point; **3rd** touch of corruption 
**Fox’s Cunning** A vulpinal’s core value is cunning. They can apply their knowledge and stories from their extensive travels to just about any situation in an instant. Before spending any other action on their turn, the vulpinal can *Recall Knowledge* as a free action. 

### E8. STAFF QUARTERS 
This unremarkable hallway connects the kitchen to the dining room. The secret door at the western end of the hall is obvious and clearly visible from this side. The small rooms to the south were originally staff living quarters, but now serve as prison cells. Each door has been set with an iron bar on the outside. Within, the rooms are stale with the odor of sweat and grime. Each room has a small bed with a pillow and blanket, and the three with a prisoner inside contain a bowl for waste. The prisoners in each room are listed below. 
**E8a**: The poet Valls is from Pashow, the smallest city-state, and is known for his storied epics of heroes from Thuvia’s past. His works are sold in bookshops scribed onto long illustrated scrolls. His readers have been awaiting the third in a trilogy for the past two years. Valls is thin and emaciated, but in good spirits when the PCs arrive. He’s prone to comparing the actions of the present to stories from the past. 
**E8b**: This room is empty aside from the previously mentioned furnishings. 
**E8c**: The tinkerer Dhia was born in Duwwor. They have been friends with Sefalia and Valls since the three met at university in Merab. Even though many of their inventions and clockwork contraptions have practical applications, they’ve always wanted to apply their aptitude for machinery to artistic endeavors. Dhia is analytical in their thinking, but prone to wild, seemingly outrageous ideas that somehow come to fruition. 
**E8d**: This room is empty aside from the furnishings. 
**E8e**: The composer Sefalia was born in Aspenthar but left the city as a youth to avoid compulsory military service, instead studying music in Merab. Known for elegant symphonies and lively dance numbers alike, Sefalia built a name for herself in Lamasara. She is thoughtful and introspective most of the time, but when she is writing music or conducting a performance she is outgoing and even frenetic. 

### E9. KITCHEN 
==Blue-painted shelves hold a few cooking vessels, plates, and pitchers. The high, arched windows provide ventilation and light. An oven and table stand on the western wall. A door in the northeast opens to a pantry; the eastern date groves are accessible through the southeastern door.==
Like most places in the house, this room has not been treated kindly by the current occupants. They use the kitchen to prepare meals but don’t spend any effort keeping it clean and tidy. 
**Treasure**: A character who *Searches* the room finds an unbroken jar on a high shelf that contains *50 gp*. 
### E10. REHEARSAL ROOM MODERATE 6 
==Wooden shelves and racks line the eastern wall of this room, and numerous benches and chairs are arranged in clusters throughout the area. The walls here are covered with wooden lattices, and climbing vines grow up them from channels of bare earth. The ceiling has a round opening, and a few birds perch there. Pillows and blankets are tucked into baskets in the northeast and southwest corners of the room.== 
Sefalia transformed this room into a rehearsal hall. While the acoustics of the central domed room are unmatched, they’re also almost too forgiving. She found it easier to practice and compose here where she could hear the mistakes she made more easily. The climbing vines dampen the echoes in the chamber and give performances a warmer sound. 
**Creatures**: One of the Usij cultists who answered Zridi’s call was a musician named Amar. Originally from a group of desert nomads who dwelled near Duwwor, Amar’s life changed 30 years ago when he and his family traveled too close to the House of Oblivion. Ambushed by divs, Amar’s life was spared only because Zridi intervened, claiming she wanted to show mercy. Zridi’s motives, of course, were to gain an ally whose mind she could turn to the cause of ruin. She saw to it that Amar was trained in music and indoctrinated into an Usij cult. He eventually rose to prominence and took over leadership of the cell. He fights to the death with fanatical fervor, as do his companions.

### E11. PRAYER ROOM 
The floors and walls of this room are covered with mosaic tiles in shades of yellows and oranges, but many of them are shattered and broken. This room was originally a shrine to *Sarenrae*. A PC who *Investigates* the room and succeeds at a *DC 20 Religion check* realizes the opening in the ceiling is designed to capture the light of the sun at noon, and the tiles show the divine flame of Sarenrae’s holy light. On a critical success, they identify the images on the walls as Sarenrae’s herald, the holy Sunlord Thalachos, and the eleven divine doves that accompany him. PCs who spend at least 2 hours *Investigating* find other images of scenes and creatures associated with Sarenrae. 
**Treasure**: A character who *Searches* the area finds a *[[Necklace of Fireballs II]]* tucked under the debris. 

> [!NOTE] REDEEMING KYEM AND DALEESHA
>  Given the vulpinals’ relatively recent turn to evil and their normally pure hearts, the PCs may wish to help them seek redemption instead of fighting. This change is possible, although it is difficult to accomplish. The twins must first be taken away from evil influences and convinced they have done something wrong. At a bare minimum, this requires shifting their attitude to helpful. (Their initial attitude is hostile.) After that, the PCs would likely need to enlist aid to guide these two down the path of redemption. A follow-up to this adventure could include the PCs bringing Kyem and Daleesha to the local temple of Shelyn for atonement, for surely the Eternal Rose views the loss of these creatures to the cause of evil as an insult. If the PCs help the twins on their path to redemption, award them 80 XP in addition to the XP for defeating them in combat. 

### E12. GUEST BEDROOM SEVERE 6 
==Tapestries hang from white plastered walls, and the arched ceiling has several open windows to let the heat vent upward while a tiled floor remains cool. A bed is tucked into the alcove to the south. A writing desk is on the eastern wall next to a wardrobe. An open door to the west leads into a bathroom.==
Since Seddek has been staying here most nights, he pilfered furniture and supplies from the rest of the house to make himself comfortable. He frequently spends time in this room when he is not directly undertaking a mission for Zridi. 
**Creature**: Seddek spent his youth traveling the deserts of Thuvia, searching for adventure and seeking ways to make him stand apart from other members of the loosely associated jann who made Thuvia their home. He explored ruins, battled dangerous creatures, and started to build a heroic and noble name for himself, a sure sign he was destined to be a leader among the jann. He was bothered, however, by the sheer number of sun orchid hunters he encountered on his travels, and the offhand way they treated the lands they trampled through in search of the rare plant. It was with anger and resentment in his heart that Seddek encountered the fabled House of Oblivion, once occupied by Ahriman and still carrying his corrupting touch. Something there called to him, and he began to have dreams that offered power, prestige, and glory in exchange for service. Soon he found the source of these dreams: the pairaka Zridi. He has since served the div as her most devoted servant. 
In combat, Seddek prefers to wade into battle and rely on his physical power. He *flees to Zridi if reduced below 30 HP*, potentially joining her in the final battle.

### RESCUING THE ARTISTS 
Once the PCs have eliminated the threats in the house or otherwise escorted the prisoners to safety, they will likely have a number of questions about the artists’ ordeal. The three collaborators beg them to find their captors and put an end to their schemes. Below is the basic information each of them knows—feel free to change or alter this information to include other details about Zridi and her plans if you wish. Read or paraphrase the following. ==“I suppose I should start,” says a short, emaciated man. “I’m Valls, a poet by trade, and these are my friends Dhia and Sefalia. Thank you for rescuing us. I’ve been a prisoner here the longest; I think for about three weeks, although it’s hard to remember for certain. I was at my house working on the words that would make up the anbarit,” he glances at his partners and continues, “when I was attacked by a janni, his attendant hoodlums, and some wolf-like creatures made of sand. 
“I’m not much of a fighter, so they had an easy time of it and soon bundled me off to a riverboat in Lamasara where I met with Zridi. It was good to see a familiar face, even if it was her, and at first I thought she was there to help me. She was a former patron—a huge fan of my work, mind you— but instead she was working with these kidnappers! Honestly, she seemed to be in charge. They put me to work— under considerable duress—making alterations to the anbarit. Believe me, I resisted at first, but they did terrible things to me and threatened to harm others if I didn’t do as they say. So, I just began writing what she wanted me to write.” 
Dhia pipes up. “That is similar to what happened with me, although Zridi accompanied the kidnappers herself.” The tinkerer pauses for a moment and continues. “She ordered those bug creatures, those gremlins, to kill everyone else and take me captive. I could hear my assistants screaming as they knocked me out.” They pause for a moment. “And now I’ve been forced to alter my creations to follow Zridi’s orders. Who knows what those gremlins have done to my workshop. I threatened to break my own fingers, but she said she’d kill Valls and Sefalia if I did.” 
“Yes,” says the woman, “I was captured here in my own home. This janni, Seddek, he’s called by the others, was in charge most of the time. I was forced to create new music for a performance. Zridi definitely has a clear idea of what she wants: engaging music filled with disharmony.” 
Valls speaks again. “We know that Zridi is trying to do something to the anbarit. All the rewrites I have been told to make are really the opposite message we wanted to convey. Instead of unity, disharmony. Instead of fellowship, isolation. We are sure Zridi plans to undertake this performance as part of some larger ritual, but I’m afraid we don’t know where or how she plans to do this.” ==
The three prisoners are willing to share that the work they’d been creating was titled The Amity Cycle, a performance they hoped would build trust between the five cities of Thuvia and instill pride in the Thuvian people. They’d been working in secret, putting up posters with hints about the upcoming show scattered around Lamasara to generate curiosity and interest. 
Once freed, the three artists decide to clean up the house and keep themselves safe within. They rebuff any additional protection, claiming they can take care of themselves if the PCs can track Zridi down and put a stop to her dangerous plans. If the PCs need additional information during the rest of the adventure, they can return here at any time to find the three artists. Sefalia offers her home to them whenever they might need a meal or a place to stay.
