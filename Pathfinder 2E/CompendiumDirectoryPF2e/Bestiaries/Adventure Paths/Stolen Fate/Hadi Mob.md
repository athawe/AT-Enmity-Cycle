aemons, including leukodaemons, once ruled over part of the fallen city of Kho. While they did, they created the first hadis.

Hadis look more fiendish and sinister than typical ratfolk. In hadi society, those who foster and cultivate blights and sickness are alchemists known as "tafens". Others, known as "rajwans," focus their training on brutal combat and barbarian rages.

Individually, most hadis are no match for a high level group, but when confronted in their lair, they can gather together into a dangerous mob.

## Hadi Evil

Although the original hadis created by daemons in ages past were ascended from rats infused with fiendish qualities that tempered their sapience with an engineered evil, over the generations the hadi people have formed their own society. They cling to evil ways largely out of tradition or fear, but there are an increasing number of hadis who admire Kho's derhiis and seek their own paths. Others, particularly those who have traveled far from Kho, have come to understand the plight of their folk under the weight of a fiendish past. Non-evil hadi thus exist, but they are viewed by those in positions of power in Kho as dangers to the social order. These hadi do not carry the pestilence their more sinister kin do and many actively work to suppress the spread of illnesses.
