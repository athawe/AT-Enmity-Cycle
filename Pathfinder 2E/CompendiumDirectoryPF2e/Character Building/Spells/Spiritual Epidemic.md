The curse continues to spread in this way.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 2]] for 1 round.\n\n**Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 2]] for 1 minute and [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] permanently.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 3]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 3]] for 1 minute and [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] and [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 2]] permanently."
