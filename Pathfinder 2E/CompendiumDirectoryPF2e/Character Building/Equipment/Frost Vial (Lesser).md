The liquid reagents in this vial rapidly absorb heat when exposed to air. A frost vial deals the listed cold damage and cold splash damage. On a hit, the target takes a status penalty to its Speeds until the end of its next turn. Many types of frost vial also grant an item bonus to attack rolls.

The bomb deals 1d6 cold damage and 1 cold splash damage, and the target takes a -5-foot penalty.
