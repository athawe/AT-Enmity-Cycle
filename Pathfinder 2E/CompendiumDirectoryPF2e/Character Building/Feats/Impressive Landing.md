# Impressive Landing `pf2:r`
## Feat 10
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You fall at least 10 feet and land on a solid surface.

* * *

You slam into the ground, shattering it around you. Treat the fall as 10 feet shorter. You land on your feet. All adjacent spaces become difficult terrain, and creatures in those spaces when you land take 5 bludgeoning damage as the debris hits them and are [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of their next turn.
