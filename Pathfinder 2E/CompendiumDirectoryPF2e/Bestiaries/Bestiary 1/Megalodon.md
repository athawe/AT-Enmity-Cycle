Prehistoric sharks of incredible size, strength, and ferocity, megalodons scour waters deep and shallow to sate their considerable hunger. The presence of a megalodon undeniably affects the local aquatic ecosystem.

* * *

Sharks of all shapes and sizes have stalked the oceans, largely unchanged, since primordial times. They are efficient, ruthless predators with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth capable of rending prey in an instant. Their uncanny ability to smell blood in the water means sharks might show up at any scene of aquatic carnage.
