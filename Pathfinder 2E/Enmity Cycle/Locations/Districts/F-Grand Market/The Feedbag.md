The Other Hand CRIMINAL EMPLOYER MUNICIPAL PARLOR RESTAURANT 
**District** Grand Market
The town’s most notorious and dangerous tavern—it’s an open secret that it’s a front for the The Other Hand. 
**Wares** standard food and drink, including cheese curd soup, Foamer’s Gulp (frothy ale served in an oversized mug), lard fries (strips of pork skin fried in seasoned lard), and Old Murdermaw stout 
[[Deyad Vhiski]] (NE male human rogue 7; indifferent; *Perception DC 22, Will DC 20*) If a PCs earns the support of the Feedbag, Deyad trusts them enough that he allows them to pursue minor thefts in town as long as the PC makes sure to “donate” part of the funds to the The Other Hand. This allows a PC to Earn Income with Thievery without worrying about being caught on a failure. On a critical failure, though, the PC is put on “probation” by the club until they pay a fine equal to their level ×10 in gp to the club; that PC loses support of the Feedbag. 
A PC can also attempt to Earn Income using Thievery at a task level of up to 7 if they wish, but doing so can result in unpleasant repercussions. If the PC’s Thievery check to Earn Income fails to beat Deyad’s Perception DC, the crime lord notices the PC’s unsanctioned theft and cuts ties with the entire party. At this point, the Feedbag no longer supports the PCs, Deyad’s attitude toward the party becomes hostile, and the party’s Reputation Points with the The Other Hand are reduced to –5.
