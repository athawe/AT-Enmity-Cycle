A patchwork of humanoid flesh makes up a _skinsaw mask_, which is stitched together with black silk or wire. It is distinctive for its bulbous orange eye- crafted from a magical glass bauble-and wide row of teeth. When worn, the mask amplifies your ability to sense fear in other creatures. You know the value of the [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened]] condition of any [[Conditions/Observed|Observed]] creature, and you gain a +1 item bonus to Perception checks to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] frightened creatures. Whenever you deal precision damage to a frightened creature, you deal 1 additional precision damage. If you are not evil, you are [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 2]] while wearing the _skinsaw mask_.
