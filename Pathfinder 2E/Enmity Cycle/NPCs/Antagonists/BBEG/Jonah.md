### Key Info

%% Essential information for the PCs, necessary clues, etc. _NOT_ key info about the NPC (that's what background is for). %%

1. Goals - He wants to make Thuvia the next Geb, with him as its leader. Maybe his base is inside of some ruins in Osirion. He could be funding or manipulating her.
2. Resources 
	- His magic - he specializes in necromantic and enchantment spells. 
		- [Corpse Communion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rituals.aspx?ID=94) ritual to learn all kinds of knowledge from the dead.
		- 
	- Has an automaton from the Jistka Imperium, named **TREAD-5**. He keeps it inside of a set of old armour that covers up the stellar craftsmanship. Everyone just thinks it's some animated armour. Really it works as his trustworthy secondary caster for [[Create Undead]] rituals, as well as operating as a sniper to help him get more bodies to build his army privately. The soul encased in the automaton was the former student to Irenicus, a Jistkan scientist of repute. 
	- Jonah has Indrajit and Zridi manipulate The Lingering Note and the Other Hand respectively. 
	- His money comes from business dealings where the Other Hand sells procured organs for profit. The rest of the bodies? His risen forces!
- Both arcane and divine casters can become liches (according to PathfinderWiki) but the process is different for each creature, that's why it takes hundreds of thousands of gold for each one.
