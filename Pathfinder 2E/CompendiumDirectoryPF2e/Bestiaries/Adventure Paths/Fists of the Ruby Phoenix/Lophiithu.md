    desc: "  A creature hit by a lophiithu's lure must succeed at a DC 41 Will check save or be [[Conditions/Fascinated|Fascinated]] with the lophiithu's lures for 1 minute. On a critical failure, it can't use reactions while it remains fascinated. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune for 1 hour."

  - name: "Dimensional Swallow"
    desc: "  The lophiithu's digestive organs exist in the Maelstrom, regardless of the location of their external form. The lophiithu can swallow any number of creatures of any size. Creatures that Escape the lophiithu's stomach do so normally. Creatures that cut themselves free instead find themselves in the Maelstrom near nothing but one of the lophiithu's disembodied stomachs. When the lophiithu dies, their stomach becomes a rift connecting to their mouth, allowing a creature to return to their plane. This rift disappears after 1 minute."

```



Lophiithus dwell in the deepest ocean trenches, places untouched by light, hope, or mortal comprehension. They appear to be gaping maws with distended jaws, vestigial flaps of putrefying flesh, and filamentous tentacles tipped with glowing light. Their extraplanar mouths take up most of their bodies, leaving no room for other organs, and any prey they swallow is transported to the Maelstrom for digestion.
