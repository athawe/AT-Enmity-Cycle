# Loyal Warhorse
## Feat 6
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** divine ally (steed)
* * *
You and your mount have grown closer, and your loyalty to each other is unbreakable. The mount you gained through the divine ally class feature is now a mature animal companion. In addition, your mount never attacks you, even if it is magically compelled to do so.
