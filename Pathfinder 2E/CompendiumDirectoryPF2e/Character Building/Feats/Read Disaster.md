# Read Disaster
## Feat 8
### [[exploration]][[oracle]][[prediction]]

**Category** class; 




You spend 10 minutes and open yourself to the divine mysteries of the world, peering into the most sinister portents of the future.

You gain the effects of [[Spells/Augury|Augury]], except you learn only about the dangers ahead; any results of "weal" are instead "nothing," and results of "weal and woe" are instead "woe." If you are legendary in Religion, you take only 1 minute to Read Disaster.
