# Cavalier Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Nature or Society
* * *
You gain a young animal companion that serves as your mount. You can choose from animal companions with the mount special ability, as well as any additional options from your pledge, as determined by your GM. You must choose an animal companion that's at least one size larger than you, but if the animal usually starts as Small, you can begin with a Medium version of that animal (changing no statistics other than its size).

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Cavalier|Cavalier]] archetype. This restriction is waived if you have pledged to the organization associated with the other dedication feat. For example, if you are pledged to a Hellknight order, you could take Hellknight dedication feats without needing to gain other feats from the cavalier archetype first.
