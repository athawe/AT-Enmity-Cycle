# Wand of Slaying (7th-Level Spell)
## Item 16
### [[magical]][[wand]]


**Price** 10000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This polished black wand has a green gem at the tip, and anyone who looks into it sees a reflection of a grinning skull instead of their face.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** Once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Execute|Execute]] at 7th rank.

If the spell slays its target, the corpse releases void energy in a 20-foot emanation, dealing void damage equal to double the spell's rank (14 void damage).

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of finger of death of the appropriate rank.
