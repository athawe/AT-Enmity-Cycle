# Stance: Crane Stance

### 






Granted by [[Feats/Crane Stance|Crane Stance]]

You enter the stance of a crane, holding your arms in an imitation of a crane's wings and using flowing, defensive motions. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, but the only Strikes you can make are crane wing attacks. These deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits.

While in Crane Stance, reduce the DC for [[Actions/High Jump|High Jump]] and [[Actions/Long Jump|Long Jump]] by 5, and when you [[Actions/Leap|Leap]], you can move an additional 5 feet horizontally or 2 feet vertically.
