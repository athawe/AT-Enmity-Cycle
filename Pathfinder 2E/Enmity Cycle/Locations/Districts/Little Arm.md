**Jiolan Verneeth** (N male human witch 5; indifferent; *Perception DC 19, Will DC 21*) After elderly Madam Mvashti passed away and her daughter Koya accompanied Ameiko to Minkai, ownership of this building reverted to the town for a few months. It was then decided that the building would be handed over to the Mwangi, who now use it and a few neighboring buildings as a sort of hostel and waystation for nomadic travelers. If the PCs earn the support of Mvashti’s Place, Jiolan waives their base fees for spellcasting services (but still requires payment for costly components as appropriate for the spell).
