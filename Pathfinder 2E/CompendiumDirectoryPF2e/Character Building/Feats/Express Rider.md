# Express Rider
## Feat 1
### [[exploration]][[general]][[move]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Nature
* * *
You know how to encourage your mount to cover ground quickly.

When calculating your travel speed for the day while mounted, you can attempt a Nature check to [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]] to increase your mount's travel speed. The DC is determined by the GM, but is typically based on the mount's level or the difficulty of the environment, whichever is harder.

On a success, increase your mount's travel speed by half. This has no effect on your mount's movement in encounters.
