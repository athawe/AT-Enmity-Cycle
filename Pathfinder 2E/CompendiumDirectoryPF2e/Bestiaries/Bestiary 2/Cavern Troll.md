The slowed value increases by 1 each time the cavern troll ends its turn in sunlight.

Spells like [[Spells/Sunburst|Sunburst]] that create magical sunlight cannot petrify a cavern troll, but the troll is slowed 1 for 1d4 rounds after being exposed to such an effect."

Insatiable scavengers stalking the eternal gloom of the Darklands, cavern trolls consume all in their path-even rocks and minerals when more nourishing sustenance is scarce. These rocky goliaths can tunnel through stone with their iron-sharp claws.

Cavern trolls rarely venture to the surface world, for they have a debilitating vulnerability to sunlight that petrifies them on sustained contact. Unlike common trolls, cavern trolls can regenerate wounds dealt by fire. The crystalline nature of their skin, however, permits sonic attacks to neutralize their signature regeneration.

As cavern trolls age, their flinty skin becomes studded with small crystals and stones of various composition. Paragons of their kind have toothy maws replete with large, crystalline fangs. A typical cavern troll stands 14 feet in height and weighs about 2,000 pounds.
