# Derring-do
## Feat 10
### [[fortune]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




When you compound [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Panache|Panache]] with even more derring-do, it somehow tends to work out.

When you already have panache, you can roll twice and use the higher result on checks to which the circumstance bonus for having panache applies ([[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] and any skill actions listed in your swashbuckler's style).
