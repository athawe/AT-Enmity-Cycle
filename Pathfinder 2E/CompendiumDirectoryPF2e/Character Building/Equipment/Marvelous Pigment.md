Marvelous pigment comes in a small container of shifting, multicolored paint that can magically create an object painted with it. The pigment is applied with a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The paint flows as you Activate the marvelous pigment and changes color at your whim as you paint. The paint can cover a 10-foot-square, two-dimensional surface. When you're done painting, attempt a DC 30 Crafting check check.

**Critical Success** The object you painted emerges from the surface as a real, permanent object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. It's non-magical and inanimate and has no value except to certain art collectors. If you paint a creature, machine, or form of energy (such as a campfire), these depictions appear only as inanimate sculptures. The created object has a painterly appearance that clearly marks its unusual origin, but is as real as any other.

**Success** As critical success, but the object constantly sheds flakes of paint until it falls apart, destroyed, after 24 hours.

**Failure** The pigments leave a painting that doesn't quite look right and doesn't become an object.

**Critical Failure** Is it a dog? Whatever you made is a pretty lousy painting and doesn't resemble what you set out to make.
