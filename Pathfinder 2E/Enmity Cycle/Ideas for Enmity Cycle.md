## Mechanical Plans
- 3 clue rule for information.
- Slow XP progression (1200 XP per level)
- Care about encumbrance! Part of the challenge can be leaving the dungeon with all of the loot.
## Flavour Plans
- Food and spices as loot. Thuvia relies on food imports.
- Look for the rules on water requirements...even a barrel of water can be viable loot if survival issues are brought to the forefront.
- Art objects as loot. 
- The areas outside of cities are left to monsters and those brave enough to set up out in the wilderness.
- Really impress the players with the strength of a boss early to set the tone. 
- A curse inflicts a random child every generation causing it to transform into an aberrant beast upon its 16th birthday. The source of this is the ghost of a young man who was in line to be pharaoh 1000s of years ago. An artifact that his spirit has bonded with has been used as a decoration for ages. Perhaps his sword is used as part of a decorative sundial.

- I should have a workspace prepared in Obsidian for social encounters with a page for tracking reputation and social scores. Also a workspace for exploration scenes (don't forget to track time)

## Lamasara House Rules 
- Everyone is making characters at level 4 for this game, expecting to pass level 6 by the end. I'll be adding in some extra content, but not a ton. Please build short backstories for your characters, using details on the local area as well as the backstory starters below.
- This adventure takes place in the desert nation of [Thuvia](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Thuvia). There are 5 main settlements here, each with distinct culture. You'll likely be someone from one of them unless you wish to be from somewhere else in the [Golden Road](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Golden_Road) subregion. Still, the adventure starts in Lamasara, so if you're not from there then you need to have a reason for why you've come. 
#### Ancestries
- All core Common ancestries are available. Humans and Dwarves have a significant representation in the populace.
- Catfolk are also Common in this region.
- Most humans in the area are at least part [Garundi:](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Garundi_(human_ethnicity)) 
#### Backgrounds 
- Common backgrounds, though a few from the World Guide book are great choices - [[Black Market Smuggler]], [[Desert Tracker]], [[Merabite Prodigy]], [[Secular Medic]], and [[Thuvian Unifier]]. 
#### Classes 
- I would recommend against Alchemist, Champion, Oracle, and Summoner. 
#### XP 
- We're using Slow XP Progression, so level ups occur at 1200 XP instead of 1000.
#### Other 
- Starting Gear and Loot for level 4 characters: 
	- 30 gp, 
	- 1 3rd level permanent item, 
	- 2 2nd level permanent items, 
	- 1 1st level permanent item. 
	- This is less than you would normally have if you had played levels 1-3, but that is to accommodate the fact that you get to select the items that you want. (Also this is how it's done in the rules)
- the most frequently spoken languages are [Common](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Common "Common"), [Kelish](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kelish "Kelish"), [Mwangi](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Mwangi_(language) "Mwangi (language)"), [Osiriani](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Osiriani "Osiriani"), [Vudrani](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Vudrani_(language) "Vudrani (language)"), and [Tien](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Tien_(language) "Tien (language)"). Popular [deities](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Deity "Deity") worshipped in the country include [Abadar](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Abadar "Abadar"), [Gozreh](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Gozreh "Gozreh"), [Nethys](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Nethys "Nethys"), [Pharasma](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Pharasma "Pharasma"), [Sarenrae](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sarenrae "Sarenrae"), and Torag.
- The party can hand out Hero Points 
	- When a player has a rules question and another can answer it, perhaps they should be rewarded with a hero point?
- I'm allowing bucklers to be Raised while holding light objects in the same hand.
- I'm allowing reloading of items that take 2 or more actions to reload to be split up over multiple turns as needed (so they aren't an activity that must be completed on one turn) 
- We'll treat social interactions as if players are always [Following the Expert](https://2e.aonprd.com/Activities.aspx?ID=4) on whoever has the highest relevant skill.
- This game won't run with the expectation that all enemies are going to be perfectly balanced for the party by coincidence. There will be enemies too high level to fight. Literal dragons (at least one) will drop out of the sky if the dice will it. And there will be ones too easy to grant experience. That's part of making this feel like a more realistic world for immersion. That means it's up to the characters to study what they see before it's too late.
- **Recall Knowledge**
	- Repeated checks will not raise DCs.
	- On top of the normal effect of Recall Knowledge, characters also get the level of a monster. I'm on the fence on making this automatic, or setting it up to reward being trained in the skills used for creature identification.
	- PCs with R.K. feats like Monster Hunter, etc. use the Level-based DC of the monster.
	- If a PC was Investigating as their exploration activity, they get one free Recall Knowledge at the start of combat.
