## Tips on adventures
Age of Ashes (1-20): classic fantasy heroics, dragons
Extinction Curse (1-20): the party are members of a travelling circus! Environmental themes.
Agents of Edgewatch (1-20): the party are city guards in the biggest fantasy metropolis in the world. Grimdark/horror themes, not appropriate for children.
Abomination Vaults (1-10): everyones favourite megadungeon. There is plot too though not just dungeon crawl.
Fists of the Ruby Phoenix (11-20): the party are entering the world famous fighting tournament, the Ruby Phoenix tournament.
Strength of Thousands (1-20): set at the Magaambya, the oldest magical academy/university in the world, in the Mwangi Expanse. They start as students and end up as teachers.
Quest for the Frozen Flame (1-10): the party are scouts for the Broken Tusk, a following (group/tribe) in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Has hexploration.
Outlaws of Alkenstar (1-10): party are criminals-with-hearts-of-gold in the steam/brasspunk city of Alkenstar
Blood Lords (1-20): party are up and coming political movers and shakers in the aristocracy of Geb, a nation with lots of undead. Must be neutral or evil, can be or become undead themselves.
Gatewalkers (1-10): paranormal investigation where players are linked by all experiencing the same paranormal event and brought together by an eccentric researcher to find out more. Uses the deviant feats rules from Dark Archive to represent the strange powers players have gained and can further develop during the campaign.
Also Kingmaker (1-20), a 2e re-release of a 1e adventure path which was crowdfunded and not part of the regular monthly adventure path release schedule. It's about kingdom building. I don't recommend it as a first AP because it will be more expensive to get all the stuff you need for it.
## Character Creation 
- Default ability boosts and flaws are not required. Any ancestry can replace them with the same boost as humans - 2 free ability boosts, no flaws. CRB pg 26
- Everyone starts with 15 gp to spend on equipment.
- Everyone is at least trained in Perception, which is based on their class.
- If you play a cleric or champion and your character’s alignment changes to one not allowed for their deity (or cause, for champions), your character loses some of their class abilities until they atone.
- Champions and clerics must worship a deity.
- It's recommended that characters are at least young adults. 
- Proficiency bonus (if untrained) = 0
- Proficiency bonus (if trained) = character level + (TEML)
	- T = 2
	- E = 4
	- M = 6
	- L = 8
- Class DC  = 10 + proficiency bonus for their class + class's key ability score.
- AC = 10 + Dex mod (up to armor's dex mod cap) + proficiency bonus with your armour + armour's item bonus to AC + other permanent bonuses  & penalties
- Int mod extra languages known beyond what Ancestry gives you.
- Starting HP = Ancestry HP + Class HP + Con mod.
- Cavern Elf, Elf Tiefling, a reskinned Vishkanya, or even a bog-standard Fleshwarp can all act as a satisfying PC **Drow**
## Classes 
- HP from level gain is flat apart from Con Mod.
## Skills
- A circumstance, condition, or effect might bar you from a skill action regardless of your proficiency rank, and sometimes using a skill in a specific situation might require you to have a higher proficiency rank than what is listed on the table.
- The GM decides whether a task requires a particular proficiency rank.
- The most important DCs to remember are the *5 simple skill DCs*
- #### Simple Skill DCs
	- Untrained - 10
	- Trained     - 15
	- Expert       - 20
	- Master      - 30
	- Legendary- 40
- When someone or something tests your skill, they attempt a check against your *skill DC, which is 10 + your skill modifier*. This DC works like any other DC to determine the effect.
- *Skill modifier* = modifier of the skill’s key ability score + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties 
- For actions with the *secret* trait, the GM rolls the check and informs you of the effect without revealing the result of the roll or the degree of success. The GM rolls secret checks when your knowledge about the outcome is imperfect, like when you’re searching for a hidden creature or object, attempting to deceive someone, translating a tricky bit of ancient text, or remembering some piece of lore. This way, you as the player don’t know things that your character wouldn’t.
- Exploration activities usually take a minute or more, downtime activities may take a day or more.
- General skill actions can be used with multiple different skills. [[Decipher Writing]] , [[Earn Income]] , [[Identify Magic]] , and [[Learn a Spell]] are trained General Skill Actions. [[Recall Knowledge]] and [[RPG Note Vault/Pathfinder 2E/Mechanics/Activities/Subsist|Subsist]] are untrained ones.
## Equipment 
- PCs start with 15 gp
- Items without prices can't be purchased
- Ones with Price = 0 are normally free.
- Most sell for half, but coins, gems, art objects and raw materials go for full price.
- If item level not listed it is 0.
- Characters can use items above their level, but they can't Craft items above their level. 
- All items are held, worn or stowed. Stowed is in a backpack and harder to reach.
- Carrying Capacity : 5 + Strength Mod number of Bulk. Maximum possible is 10 + Strength mod.
- Encumbered - clumsy 1 and -10 foot penalty to all Speeds. This can't reduce your Speed below 5 feet.
- 10 light items = 1 bulk. This rounds down so 9 light items is still 0 bulk.
- Negligible items don't count unless you try to carry vast numbers, as determined by the GM. 
- Generally, 1 bulk is around 5 to 10 pounds. A few ounces is negligible, and anything in between is light.
- Also, an item being difficult to move with can increase Bulk, and items for larger and smaller creatures are more or less Bulk.
- Coins - 1000 coins is 1 Bulk. Round down by the thousands. Don't count 100 coins as light. 1999 coins is 1 Bulk not 2.
- Creature Bulk 
	- Tiny - 1
	- Small - 3
	- Medium - 6 
	- Large - 12
	- Huge - 24 
	- Gargantuan - 48 
- Dragging halves the Bulk but moves slowly 
- Items only take damage when creatures target them normally. eg. doors and traps. 
- #### Armour 
- AC = 10 + Dex Mod (up to armour's dex cap) + prof bonus + armour's item bonus to AC + other bonuses and penalties 
- 1 minute to don light armour, 5 minutes for medium or heavy 
- 1 minute to remove any armour. 
- A suit of armour that's carried has 1 more Bulk than what is in the table. 
- #### Shields
- Damage that goes over a shield's Hardness is dealt to both the shield and the holder. So if 9 damage is coming in, shield has a Hardness of 5, then both the shield AND the holder take 4 damage.
- I'm allowing bucklers to be Raised while holding light objects in the same hand.
- #### Weapons 
- *Melee attack modifier* = Strength modifier (or optionally Dexterity for a finesse weapon) + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties 
- *Ranged attack modifier* = Dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties 
- *Melee damage roll* = damage die of weapon or unarmed attack + Strength modifier + bonuses + penalties
- *Ranged damage roll* = damage die of weapon + Strength modifier for thrown weapons + bonuses + penalties
- Improvised weapons take a -2 item penalty to attack rolls. GM determines the damage. 
- Weapon damage dice only increase in size once. 
- Range increments go to a maximum of 6 increments, with -2 penalty to attack rolls. ex. a shortbow fires normally within 60 feet, and has a maximum range of 360 feet.
- I'm allowing reloading of items that take 2 or more actions to reload to be split up over multiple turns as needed (so they aren't an activity that must be completed on one turn)
- Using ammunition destroys it.
- #### Gear 
- You can wear up to 2 Bulk in tools so they're easy to get to. You can draw and replace them in the same action as you use them.
- Several typical pieces of gear have better versions that give item bonuses to their usage, ex. extreme climbing kit. 
- Class kits to quickly outfit a character with what they need. 
## Spells 
- *Spell attack roll* = your spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
- *Spell DC* = 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
- Spontaneous casters have to relearn spells at higher levels if they want to heighten them. 
- If a heightened spell details certain levels where it gets stronger, only apply the details for the level that applies, not the ones below it.
- Heightened (+1) acts like typical upcasting from 5e.
- Cantrips and Focus Spells are always heightened to half your level rounded up.
- ### Casting Spells 
- When you Cast a Spell, your spellcasting creates obvious visual manifestations of the gathering magic, although feats such as Conceal Spell (CRB page 210) and Melodious Spell (CRB page 101) can help hide such manifestations or otherwise prevent observers from noticing that you are casting.
- Spell Components 
	- Material - you need a free hand to retrieve and manipulate it.
	- Somatic - you can use this component while holding something in your hand, but not if you are restrained or unable to gesture freely. Spells that require touching the target require a somatic component
	- Verbal - you must speak them in a strong voice.
	- Focus - you need a free hand or to already have the focus in hand. As part of Casting the Spell you can retrieve it, manipulate it, and even put it away again.
- You must be able to see your target or perceive them using a precise sense to target it normally. GM may rule that you can attempt to target them (Detecting Creatures, CRB 465-467)
- If a target ceases to be a valid target during a spell's duration, the spell typically ends.
- For willing targets - a player can declare that their character is willing or unwilling at any time, regardless of turn order or current condition. 
- You need an unobstructed path to the target of a spell, origin point of an area, or place where you create something with a spell. (CRB 457)
- A spell might last until the start or end of a turn, for some number of rounds, for minutes, or even longer.
- Even if the caster dies or is incapacitated during a spell's duration, it stays in effect till its duration ends. 
- If the spell’s duration is “sustained,” it lasts until the end of your next turn unless you use a Sustain a Spell action on that turn to extend the duration of that spell 
- Unless a spell has a different max duration (sustained up to 1 minute, etc) sustaining a spell for longer than 10 minutes ends the spell and makes you fatigued.
- Spells with an unlimited duration last until counteracted or Dismissed.
- Basic Saving Throws - If a spell’s Saving Throw entry specifies a “basic” saving throw, the spell’s potential effects all relate to the damage listed in the spell’s description. The target takes no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, full damage on a failure, or double damage on a critical failure.
- ### Identifying Spells 
- If you notice a spell being cast, have the spell prepared or in your repertoire, then you automatically know what it is and the level it's been heightened to. 
- If you don't know it or have it prepped then you can spend an action on your turn to [[Recall Knowledge]]. If it's a long-lasting spell that is already in place you have to use the [[Identify Magic]] action instead because you didn't get to see the spell being cast.
- ### Triggers 
- You can set simple sensory cues to cause spells to activate. Spells like [[Magic Mouth]] , etc.
- disguises and illusions can fool the spell. The origin point needs line of sight to see something. Darkness doesn't prevent that, but invisibility (or a successful [[RPG Note Vault/Pathfinder 2E/Mechanics/Rules/Actions/Hide|Hide]] ) does. Auditory detection doesn't need line of sight. A [[RPG Note Vault/Pathfinder 2E/Mechanics/Rules/Actions/Sneak|Sneak]] can fool the sensor.
- ### Stealthy Spell Casting 
- Wizards and Witches have access to the [[conceal-spell|Conceal Spell]] feat. 
- Bards have access to the [[melodious-spell|Melodious Spell]] feat.
- Everyone else that  can take the [[spellmaster-locg|Spellmaster]] archetype, which gives them access to the [[surreptitious-spellcaster-locg|Surreptitious Spellcaster]] feat.  

## Playing the Game 
- Encounter Mode, Exploration Mode, Downtime.
- Degrees of Success. Remember that the result of a roll is more important than a nat 1 or nat 20, because those just adjust the result by one step.
- Specific overrides General 
- **Round down unless otherwise specified.**
- Multiplying 
	- When more than one effect would multiply the same number, don’t multiply more than once. Instead, combine all the multipliers into a single multiplier, with each multiple after the first adding 1 less than its value. For instance, if one ability doubled the duration of one of your spells and another one doubled the duration of the same spell, you would triple the duration, not quadruple it
- Duplicate Effects 
	- When you’re affected by the same thing multiple times, only one instance applies, using the higher level of the effects, or the newer effect if the two are the same level.
- Circumstance Bonuses, Item Bonuses, and Status Bonuses. Also penalties. However, there are untyped penalties. These do stack.  
- Checks are primarily against DCs, even on rolls between players. Your DC for a given stat is 10 + the total modifier for that stat.
- Technically a natural 20 isn't a crit, it increases your degree of success. Usually it is a crit because 20+modifier is high enough, but that's because of beating the DC or being above DC+10, not because of the natural 20 alone. So usually it's either already a crit success or the natural 20 bumps it from success to crit success. This matters because on a third strike with a -10 multiple attack penalty, you might get a natural 20 but not beat the DC. The natural 20 then turns failure into success, rather than turning success into crit success. This goes the other way too. Nat 1 lowers the result by a step. 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230616130121.png|500]]
- Your class determines your proficiency rank for various weapons.
- The two main types of untyped penalties are the multiple attack penalty and range penalty.
- #### Multiple Attack Penalty 
	- First attack no penalty, second -5 (-4 if using an agile weapon), third -10 (-8 for agile)
	- Stops going up at -10
	- All checks and actions that have the **Attack** trait count towards increasing MAP.
	- MAP only applies during your turn, so don't worry about it on other player's turns. 
- #### Range Penalty 
	- Ranged and thrown weapons have a listed range increment. Each extra increment is an additional -2, up to a max of the sixth range increment.
	- Example - crossbow range 120 feet. So a target at 150 feet imposes a -2 penalty. The max range would be the increment between 600 and 720 feet away, where you take a -10 penalty due to range.
- #### Armour Class 
	- Armor Class = 10 + Dexterity modifier (up to your armor’s Dex Cap) + proficiency bonus + armor’s item bonus to AC + other bonuses + penalties
	- Meets beats! 
	- Your armour grants an item bonus to AC. You take an item penalty when you wear shoddy armor.
- *Spell attack roll result* = d20 roll + ability modifier used for spellcasting + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
- *Spell DC* = 10 + ability modifier used for spellcasting + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
- ### Perception 
	- Perception check result = d20 roll + Wisdom modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties 
	- You’ll rarely encounter item penalties or untyped penalties for Perception.
	- Many abilities are compared to your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed. Your **Perception DC is 10 + your total Perception modifier.**
	- Perception is used for initiative.
- ### Saving Throws 
- **Saving Throw DC = 10 + the total modifier for that saving throw.**
	- Most often, saving throws don't cost an action, but sometimes you can chose to make one for things like recovering from conditions. 
- #### Basic Saving Throws 
	- Critical Success - You take no damage from the spell, hazard, or effect that caused you to attempt the save. 
	- Success - You take half the listed damage from the effect. 
	- Failure - You take the full damage listed from the effect.
	- Critical Failure - You take double the listed damage from the effect.
- #### Fortune and Misfortune Effects 
	- Alter how you roll your dice. Might allow you to reroll a failed roll, force you to reroll a successful roll, or have you roll with advantage or disadvantage. 
	- No more than one fortune effect or misfortune effect on a single roll.
	- If multiple [[fortune]] effects would apply, you choose one to use.
	- If multiple [[misfortune]] effects would apply, the GM chooses which is worse and applies it.
	- If both a fortune and misfortune effect would apply to a roll, they cancel out and you roll normally. 
- **When an ability calls for you to use the DC for a specific skill, you can calculate it by adding 10 + your total modifier for that skill.**
- ### Flat Checks 
	- For when things are based on chance. No mods, bonuses or penalties, just a d20 roll.
	- If more than 1 flat check would ever cause or prevent the same thing, just roll once with the highest DC.
- ### Secret Checks 
	- Sometimes a player shouldn't know the result and effect of a check. These checks have the [[secret]] trait.
	- GM rolls it and just describes the info or effects determined by the check's result. If you don't know the check is happening, then the GM has to apply fortune and misfortune effects 
	- If you do know it is happening (Recall Knowledge or Seek checks) then you can usually activate fortune or misfortune abilities, just tell the GM so they can apply it.
	- The GM can choose to make any check secret, even if it's not usually rolled secretly. The GM could let you roll the checks yourself too, and expect you not to act on meta knowledge.
- ### Damage 
	- Strength mod gets added to melee weapon, unarmed attack, and thrown ranged weapon damage. Weapons with the [[propulsive|Propulsive]] trait sometimes add half Strength mod.
	- Typically, you don't add an ability mod to spell damage, damage from most ranged weapons, or damage from alchemical bombs and similar items.
	- As normal for  circumstance, status, and item bonuses and penalties, you apply the greatest in each category only. For untyped penalties, you add them together.
	- *Melee damage roll* = damage die of weapon or unarmed attack + Strength modifier + bonuses + penalties
	- *Ranged damage roll* = damage die of weapon + Strength modifier for thrown weapons + bonuses + penalties
	- *Spell (and similar effects) damage roll* = damage die of the effect + bonuses + penalties
	- If penalties would reduce damage to 0 or below, you still deal 1 damage.
	- Persistent damage happens at the end of your turns. After you take it, roll a DC 15 flat check to see if you recover from it. 
	- Benefits you gain specifically from a critical hit aren't doubled. ([[fatal|Fatal]] damage die)
	- #### Immunities, Weaknesses, and Resistances 
		- Apply immunities first. 
		- Immunity to critical hits just stops double damage. 
		- Immunity to nonlethal attacks stops the whole attack's damage.
	- #### Damage Types 
		- Physical Damage 
			- Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing.
		- Energy Damage 
			- Acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic. Often useful against creatures with immunities or resistances to physical damage.
			- ~~Positive~~ *Vitality* damage harms only undead 
			- ~~Negative~~ *Void* damage damages only living creatures. 
			- Force damage - pure magic energy that is rarely resisted, even by incorporeal creatures.
		- ~~Alignment Damage 
			- ~~Chaotic, evil, good, lawful. Weapons and effects can be keyed to one of them, and their damage will harm only the opposite alignment.~~ 
		- Spirit Damage 
			- Directly attacks the spirit of a creature. Only constructs are really immune to it. It can hit something through a projection, or a possessing creature without harming the possessed creature. Can have the sanctified, holy or unholy traits. Weakness to good or evil is replaced with weakness to holy or unholy. Law and chaos damage are just removed or replaced with spirit damage, force damage, or just boosting another damage source. https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/1cagwwr/comment/l0rvc1w/ 
		- Mental Damage 
			- Mindless creatures are often immune.
		- Poison Damage 
		- Bleed Damage 
			- persistent damage that represents the loss of blood. No effect on nonliving creatures or living ones that don't need blood to live. 
			- Weaknesses and resistances to physical damage apply 
			- Bleed damage ends if you're healed to your full HP.
		- Precision Damage 
			- Increases the attack's listed damage using the same damage type instead of being a separate pool of damage.
			- Some creatures are immune to precision damage (no vital points on an ooze)
			- Resistances get applied to the whole damage after precision is added to it. 
		- Precious materials aren't a separate category, but can bypass some resistances. 
	- Note: When there are multiple instances of persistent damage with the same type but different dice values, use the one with the highest average damage.
	- Temporary Immunity 
		- Doesn't prevent or end ongoing effects, just stops new ones.
	- Weakness 
		- Will have a value, and every instance of that damage type that you take will be increased by that number.
	- Resistance 
		- Like weakness, applies to each time you take a certain type of damage. Can reduce damage to 0.
		- There can be exceptions, like resistance 10 to physical damage (except silver).
		- If multiple resistances could apply to damage just use the greater one. 
		- Resistance to all damage is possible. With it you apply the resistance to each different damage type separately. 
	- Nonlethal Attacks 
		- Weapons with the [[nonlethal]] trait do it automatically. Weapons without take a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls when trying to do nonlethal. And vice versa.
		- Spells with nonlethal trait knock people out instead of killing them.
- ### Effects 
	- Duration 
		- Effects that last a number of rounds decrease duration remaining by 1 at the start of each turn of the creature that created the effect. (common for beneficial effects)
		- Detrimental effects often last until the end of the target's next turn, or through the targets next X turns. So the duration decreases at the end of their turn.
		- Or they end when a condition has been met.
	- Range and Reach 
		- Range increment in equipment section 
		- Your Reach is typically 5 feet.
		- Larger creatures can have greater reach. (ogre has 10ft)
		- 10ft reach can reach 2 squares diagonally, this is an exception. Further doesn't keep up the trend. 20ft reach is 3 squares diagonally, 30ft is 4, etc.
	- Targets 
		- Targeting can be difficult or impossible if the creature is undetected by you. 
		- Even if you or your character don't know what the effect is, you still decide if you're willing. #playeragency
		- You don't count as your own ally. If it's not clear, the GM decides who counts as an ally or an enemy.
	- Areas 
		- 4 types: emanations, bursts, cones, and lines.
	- Line of Effect
		- 1ft square gap is enough to maintain a line of effect, though GM makes the final call. 
		- You have line of effect unless a creature is fully behind a solid physical barrier.
		- For area effects, creatures or targets must have line of effect to the point of origin to be effected.
	- Line of Sight
- ### Afflictions
	- .
- ### Counteracting
	- Critical Success Counteract the target if its counteract level is no more than 3 levels higher than your effect’s counteract level.
	- Success Counteract the target if its counteract level is no more than 1 level higher than your effect’s counteract level.
	- Failure Counteract the target if its counteract level is lower than your effect’s counteract level.
	- Critical Failure You fail to counteract the target 
- ### Hit Points, Healing, and Dying (pg 459)
	- Knocked out and Dying 
	- Recovery Checks 
		- Start of your turn, flat check. DC = 10 + dying value.
		- Critical Success Your dying value is reduced by 2.
		- Success Your dying value is reduced by 1. 
		- Failure Your dying value increases by 1. 
		- Critical Failure Your dying value increases by 2
	- Heroic Recovery 
	- Death Effects and Instant Death 
		- Abilities with the [[death|Death]] trait kill you if they drop you to 0.
		- Some will state that they kill you outright, without even needing to account for your HP. 
	- Massive Damage 
		- Damage greater than max HP doubled in one blow instantly kills you.
	- Temp HP works like it does in 5e, though most last for a limited duration.
	- Fast Healing and [[regeneration|Regeneration]] 
		- Both heal you at the start of your turn.
		- [[regeneration|Regeneration]] stops the creature from dying until it's deactivated.
	- Items have HP, hardness stats, and broken thresholds. You usually can't attack an attended object.
- ### Actions
	- Types: Single Action, Two-Action Activity,  Three-Action Activity, Reaction, Free Action
	- During encounters you get 3 actions at the beginning of your turn.
	- Reactions have triggers and you get 1 per round. Outside of encounters, their use is more flexible and up to the GM. 
	- **You can use only one single action, activity, or free action that doesn’t have a trigger at a time. You must complete one before beginning another.**
	- Free actions *with* triggers and reactions can be used in the middle of another action.
	- Activities - You have to complete all of the actions in an activity on your turn. If it gets interrupted or disrupted, you lose the actions you committed to it.
	- Limitations on Triggers - You can only use one action in response to a given trigger. 
	- Other actions 
		- If it's not covered in the defined actions in the game, the GM can decide how many actions something would take and the relevant traits to proceed.
	- Gaining and Losing Actions 
		- When you can't act, you can't even speak. You still regain actions unless prevented by a condition.
	- Disrupting Actions - Costs still spent, action's effects don't occur. 
		- GM decides what happens beyond just the action not happening. 
- ### Movement (CRB 463)
	- Burrow 
		- Usually doesn't leave a tunnel behind, usually requires holding breath, may need tremorsense to navigate.
	- Climb 
		- Having a climb speed means you don't have to make Athletics checks for climbing unless in extreme circumstances like hazardous conditions, across ceilings, etc.
		- It also grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Climb. And having a climb speed stops you from being flat-footed while climbing.
	- Fly 
		- Moving into wind is difficult terrain, with the wind is double speed. 
	- Swim #swim #underwater 
		- Having a swim speed means you auto succeed on Athletics checks to swim.
		- In general, moving up or down is difficult terrain.
		- Even with a swim speed you may need to make checks against hazards or turbulent water. You can choose to roll to try for a crit success. Swim speed grants a +4 circumstance bonus.
		- Swim speed doesn't give you water breathing. (CRB pg 478)
	- Falling 
		- When you fall more than 5 feet, you take bludgeoning damage equal to half the distance you fell when you land.
		- Fall damage maxes out at 750 damage (1,500 feet)
		- You fall 500 feet in the first round, and 1,500 in the following rounds.
		- [[grab-an-edge|Grab an Edge]] reaction 
		- If you fall in something soft, treat it as -20 feet distance. If you dove in, -30 feet.
		- If you land on a creature it has to make a *DC 15 Reflex save*. 
- ### Perception 
	- Light - A light source that lists bright light sheds dim light to double that radius.
		- Bright light - creatures and objects can be clearly observed, some creatures are dazzled or blinded.
		- Dim light - Creatures and objects in dim light have the concealed condition, unless the seeker has darkvision, low-light vision or a different precise sense. 
		- Darkness - A creature or object within darkness is hidden or undetected unless the seeker has darkvision or a precise sense other than vision. If you don't have [[RPG Note Vault/Pathfinder 2E/Mechanics/rules/abilities/darkvision|darkvision]] then you're blinded in areas of darkness.
		- Sudden bright light might make you dazzled for a short time. GM discretion.
	- Senses 
		- Precise senses 
			- The only way to target a creature without having drawbacks is to use a precise sense. If they are hiding or obscured you can use Seek to better detect them.
		- Imprecise senses 
			- Typically hearing. Can sense a creature, making them hidden instead of undetected. 
			- Can use the Seek basic action, but can't do better than make them hidden.
		- Vague senses
			- At best, a vague sense can be used to detect the presence of an unnoticed creature, making it undetected. Even then, the vague sense isn’t sufficient to make the creature hidden or observed 
		- The GM always uses the most precise sense available when one creature might detect another. 
		- Most abilities that designate “a creature you can see” or the like function just as well if the user can precisely sense the subject with a different sense.
		- Hide is for avoiding visual detection, Avoid Notice and Sneak are for both seen and heard.
		- In the case of a special sense, player describes how they avoid it and use the most applicable Stealth action. If needed swap Dex for whatever works. If the creature could detect you with multiple senses, use your lowest applicable ability mod.  
		- Special Senses
			- Darkvision & Greater Darkvision - see perfectly well in darkness and dim light, just in black and white.
			- [[low-light-vision|Low-Light Vision]] - sees dim light like bright light, ignoring concealed condition due to dil light.
			- Scent - usually vague. If creature is up or downwind, the range of scent abilities can be doubled, tripled, or reduced.
			- [[tremorsense|Tremorsense]] - usually imprecise sense  
		- Detect Creatures 
			- 3 conditions that measure how much you can sense a creature - [[conditions#Observed|Observed]], [[conditions#Hidden|Hidden]], and [[conditions#Undetected|Undetected]]. 
			- Concealed and Invisible can partially mask a creature 
			- Unnoticed 
			- All of these except Invisible are relative to the viewer.
			- Hidden
				- If someone is hidden to you, you're flat-footed to them.
				- Targetting someone who is hidden to you requires a *DC 11 flat check*
			- Undetected 
				- If a creature is undetected, you don’t know what space it occupies, you’re flat-footed to it, and you can’t easily target it.
				- You can Seek to make them hidden.
				- You can pick a square to attack and hope for the best. *The GM rolls your attack roll and flat check in secret.* If you miss, they don't tell you why. (You could miss the attack roll, pick the wrong square, or fail the flat check)
			- Unnoticed
		- Concealment 
			- DC 5 flat check to target them.
		- [[conditions#Invisible|Invisibility]] 
			- Automatically undetected to those relying on sight as their only precise sense. 
			- Seek to make them hidden.
			- They can Sneak to become undetected again.
			- If you observed them becoming invisibile, they start as hidden instead of undetected.
			- They could still be made hidden or even observed by certain effects. 
- ### Hero Points 
	- Only last for the current session, you start each game with one.
	- Max 3, you gain them by performing heroic deeds - something selfless, daring, or beyond normal expectations.
	- Spending Hero Points isn't an action. You can spend them for a familiar or animal companion. 
	- Spend 1 to reroll a check 
	- Spend all to end the dying condition and stabilize at 0. The wounded condition doesn't go up.
	- You should describe how you go about succeeding thanks to the hero point, drawing upon items, experiences, etc. Or ask the GM to do so, or give you some help.
- ### Encounter Mode
	- Structure 
		- You can roll initiative with stuff other than Perception if it fits. Deception or Diplomacy in social situations, Stealth when sneaking, Athletics, etc. 
	- Turns 
		- At the start of your turn, you handle reducing effect durations, healing, recovery checks, and 1 free action or triggered reaction before you regain your actions and reaction. (pg 622)
		- Each action is distinct, you can't do one while doing another. Activities must be completed on your turn. 
		- At the end of your turn, you end effects that end until then, take persistent damage, and make flat checks against the damage or saving throws against an affliction. These all happen BEFORE you reduce any conditions that changed at the end of your turn, (eg. frightened) 
		- You can also make 1 free action or reaction. 
	- Basic Actions (CRB, pg 469) [[aid]] 
		- Every creature can use Basic Actions unless special circumstances.
		- Escape can use Acrobatics or Athletics or your unarmed attack roll.
		- Ready action inherits your MAP from where it was in your turn. 
		- Release doesn't trigger reactions 
		- If an effect stops them from being observed, a creature might only become hidden when you Seek in an area they are.
	- Reactions in Encounters
		- The GM determines whether you can use reactions before your first turn begins, depending on the situation in which the encounter happens.
		- Attack of Opportunity is triggered by manipulate actions, move actions, ranged attacks, and leaving squares in reach with a move action.
	- Movement in Encounters 
		- Moving diagonally costs extra movement every other square.
		- ![[size-and-reach#Size and Reach]]
		- Each time you move out of a square within a creature's reach, your movement triggers reactions and free actions 
		- Moving through another creature's space
			- You can share a space with a prone creature 
			- Tiny creatures can end their turn in other creature's spaces.
			- You can move through willing creatures spaces 
			- You can [[tumble-through|Tumble Through]] spaces of unwilling creatures. 
			- GM decides if you can move into an object's space.
		- Forced Movement
			- Doesn't trigger reactions that are triggered by movement.
			-  Abilities that reposition you in some other way can’t put you in dangerous places unless they specify otherwise.
		- Terrain 
			- Difficult Terrain 
				- 5 extra feet for regular, 10 extra for greater difficult terrain 
				- Certain other abilities let you ignore difficult terrain on foot; such an ability also allows you to move through greater difficult terrain at the normal movement cost as for difficult terrain.
			- Narrow Surfaces - *Flat-footed*, each time you're hit or fail a save - Reflex save 
			- Uneven Ground - Balance or fall prone (maybe damage). *Flat-footed*. 
			- Inclines - Climb. *Flat-footed*!
		- Flanking
			- Flat-footed to melee attacks from the creature flanking it.
			- Both flanking creatures must be across the target, so a line from their centers pass through opposite sides or corners of the foe's space.
			- Also, both creatures must be able to attack.(Reach weapon included)
		- Cover 
			- Standard cover = +2 circumstance bonus to AC, Reflex saves against AoEs, and stealth checks to Hide, Sneak or avoid detection. Using [[take-cover|Take Cover]] brings this to greater cover which grants a +4.
			- If cover is light, often provided by another creature, it is lesser cover which grants a +1 circumstance bonus to AC ONLY.
			- You need at least standard cover to [[RPG Note Vault/Pathfinder 2E/Mechanics/rules/actions/hide|Hide]].  
			- Cover is relative from one creature to another or from an area effect's point of origin to the creature.
			- A creature two or more sizes larger than you grants standard cover instead of lesser cover.
		- Special Circumstances 
			- The GM has space to make decisions here, letting you overcome cover, do stuff like fire around corners or use arrow slits, etc. This may require an action to set up, and then cover could be measured from an edge or corner of your square instead of your center.
		- Three-Dimensional Combat 
			- Diagonals up or down in 3-D space are counted the same, every other diagonal is 10 feet.
			- Flanking works in all directions.
		- Aquatic Combat #underwater 
			- You're [flat-footed](rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed) unless you have a swim Speed.
			- You gain resistance 5 to acid and fire.
			- You take a –2 circumstance penalty to melee slashing or bludgeoning attacks that pass through water.
			- Ranged attacks that deal bludgeoning or slashing damage automatically miss if the attacker or target is underwater, and piercing ranged attacks made by an underwater creature or against an underwater target have their range increments halved.
			- You can't cast fire spells or use actions with the fire trait underwater.
			- At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work underwater or while floating.
		- Drowning 
			- You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to *5 + your Constitution modifier*. This goes down by 1 at the end of your turn, or 2 if you attacked or cast spells. You lose 1 round of air if you are crit or you crit fail a save against damage. If you speak (including for verbal spells or activating items with command components) *you lose all remaining air*.
			- When you run out of air, you fall [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) and start suffocating. You can't recover from being unconscious and must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save at the end of each of your turns. On a failure, you take 1d10 damage, and on a critical failure, you die. On each check after the first, the DC increases by 5 and the damage by 1d10; these increases are cumulative. Once your access to air is restored, you stop suffocating and are no longer unconscious (unless you're at 0 Hit Points).
- ### Exploration Mode 
	- Mostly movement and RP. Rather than deciding on each action every turn, you'll engage in an exploration activity, and you'll typically spend some time every day resting and making your daily preparations.
	- ![Travel Speed](rules/tables/travel-speed.md)
	- These speeds are on flat, clear terrain. Difficult terrain halves speed, greater difficult terrain thirds it. If the environment requires a check, likely once per hour. 
	- If you don't do anything while travelling, you move at full speed. Certain activities can slow your travel for other benefits. 
	- When you want to do something other than simply travel, you describe what you are attempting to do. It isn't necessary to go into extreme detail. The GM finds the best exploration activity to match your description and describes the effects of that activity. Some exploration activities limit how fast you can travel and be effective.
	- Most common exploration activities 
		- [[avoid-notice|Avoid Notice]] - *Half speed*, Stealth check. Use Stealth for initiative when combat starts.
		- [[defend|Defend]] - *Half speed*, shield raised. Start combat with shield up. 
		- [[RPG Note Vault/Pathfinder 2E/Mechanics/rules/actions/detect-magic|Detect Magic]] - *Half speed*, casting [[RPG Note Vault/Pathfinder 2E/Mechanics/rules/actions/detect-magic|detect-magic]] frequently. When moving up to 300 ft/minute you will see all auras, when moving up to 150 ft/minute you see all auras BEFORE the party moves into them.
		- [[follow-the-expert|Follow the Expert]] - Add your level to a check by following an ally who is an expert in that skill and performing it as well. Gain a +2/3/4 bonus based on their proficiency rank - expert/master/legendary.
		- [[hustle|Hustle]] - ==Double speed==. Maintainable for Con Mod x 10 minutes. Lowest one in the group determines how long it can be done.
		- [[investigate|Investigate]] - *Half speed*, secret [[recall-knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] check for information. You use any skill with the recall knowledge action, but the GM determines if it's relevant to the clues you could find. 
		- [[repeat-a-spell|Repeat a Spell]]  - *Half speed*, repeatedly casting a spell, usually a cantrip. Must be castable in 2 actions or fewer. You can instead use this activity to keep Sustaining a Spell or Activation with a sustained duration.
		- [[RPG Note Vault/Pathfinder 2E/Mechanics/rules/actions/scout|Scout]] - *Half speed*. Watch ahead and behind the party. Grant everyone a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls for the next encounter.
		- [[search|Search]] - *Half Speed*. Seek for hidden doors, concealed hazards, etc. Half speed relies on your best guess for places to check. To check everything, move no faster than 300 ft/minute, and to check everything BEFORE you move into it, move no faster than 150 ft/minute. If you come across something, the GM makes a secret check to Seek if you notice it.

## Game Mastering 
- Lots of stuff about Don't Be An Asshole 
- If players want to use common options from other books or uncommon or rare options, through play, review those options to see if any of them conflict with the style of campaign you have in mind or might present strange surprises down the road. It's usually best to allow new options, but there's no obligation to do so. Be as open as you're comfortable with.
- ### Rarity 
	- The rarity system has two purposes: to convey how common or rare certain spells, creatures, or items are in the game world, and to give you an easy tool to control the complexity of your game. Uncommon and rare options aren't more powerful than other options of their level, but they introduce complications for certain types of stories, or are less common in the world. For instance, it might be more challenging to run a mystery adventure when a player can cast an uncommon spell such as detect evil.
	- At the start of the campaign, communicate your preferred expectations on rarity to the players. Unless you decide otherwise, the players can choose from any common options they qualify for, plus any uncommon options granted by their character choices—primarily their ancestry and class. By default, a character who tries hard enough might eventually find an uncommon option, whereas a rare option is always a special reward.
	- Beyond that baseline, you can grant access as freely as you want; some GMs open up all uncommon and rare options universally. If you're not sure, just look over any uncommon or rare elements before you include them as rewards or otherwise allow a player to acquire them.  
- ### Rewards
	- Uncommon and rare options can be used as rewards. Items most commonly, though uncommon rare spells work too. You could also allow the players to use these rare things to gain extra rewards and gold.
- ### Different Locations 
	- The default rarities are for Inner Sea region of Golarion, but should fit a western medieval fantasy game. Feel free to modify them, though communicate the changes to your group. 
- ### Building Encounters 
	- **Trivial-threat** encounters are so easy that the characters have essentially no chance of losing. These encounters work best as warm-ups, palate cleansers, or reminders of how awesome the characters are.
	- **Low-threat** encounters present a veneer of difficulty and typically use some of the party's resources.
	- **Moderate-threat** encounters are a serious challenge to the characters, though unlikely to overpower them completely. Characters usually need to use sound tactics and manage their resources wisely to come out of a moderate-threat encounter ready to continue on and face a harder challenge without resting.
	- **Severe-threat** encounters are the hardest encounters most groups of characters can consistently defeat. These encounters are most appropriate for important moments in your story, such as confronting a final boss. Bad luck, poor tactics, or a lack of resources due to prior encounters can easily turn a severe-threat encounter against the characters, and a wise group keeps the option to disengage open.
	- **Extreme-threat** encounters are so dangerous that they are likely to be an even match for the characters, particularly if the characters are low on resources. This makes them too challenging for most uses. An extreme threat encounter might be appropriate for a fully rested group of characters that can go all-out, for the climactic encounter at the end of an entire campaign, or for a group of veteran players using advanced tactics and teamwork.
- ### XP Budget 
	- XP budget based on desired threat level of encounter. Creatures and hazards cost XP, based on their level compared to the party's level.
	- If you adjust the XP budget based on party size, the XP awards don't change.
	- Encounters are typically more satisfying if the number of enemy creatures is fairly close to the number of player characters.
- ### Running a Game Session
	- Starting a Session 
		- Recap previous session
		- Establish where the characters are and if they had time to rest since the last session 
		- Remind the players of their 1 Hero Point 
		- Establish goals. Remind them of any that they already had.
		- Commence adventuring! Decide which mode of play you're going to start in, then lead off with a verbal prompt.
	- Running a Session 
		- You’re in charge of keeping the game’s action moving, managing the different modes of play, fielding questions, and making rules decisions.
	- ### Adjudicating the Rules <sup>CRB p. 491</sup>
		- Keeping your game moving is more important than being 100% correct. Looking up rules at the table can slow the game down, so in many cases it's better to make your best guess. (Look those rules up during a break or after the session!) To make calls on the fly, use the following guidelines, which are **the same principles the game rules are based on**. You might want to keep printouts of these guidelines and the DC guidelines (page 503) for quick reference.
			- If you don't know **how long** a quick task takes, go with 1 action, or 2 actions if a character shouldn't be able to perform it three times per round.
			- If you're not sure what action a task uses, look for the **most similar basic action**. If you don't find one, make up an undefined action (page 462) adding any necessary traits (usually attack, concentrate, manipulate, or move).
			- When two sides are opposed, have one roll against the other's DC. **Don't have both sides roll** (initiative is the exception to this rule). The character who rolls is usually the one acting (except in the case of saving throws).
			- If an effect raises or lowers chances of success, grant a **+1 circumstance bonus or a –1 circumstance penalty**.
			- If you're not sure how difficult a significant challenge should be, use the DC for the **party's level**.
			- If you're making up an effect, creatures should be **incapacitated or killed** on only a critical success (or for a saving throw, on a critical failure).
			- If you don't know what check to use, pick the **most appropriate skill**. If no other skill applies to a check to [Recall Knowledge](rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md), use an appropriate [Lore](compendium/skills.md#Lore) skill (usually at an untrained proficiency rank).
			- Use the characters' **daily preparations** as the time to reset anything that lasts roughly a day.
			- When a character accomplishes something noteworthy that doesn't have rules for XP, award them XP for an **accomplishment** (10 to 30 XP, as described 1).
			- When the PCs fail at a task, look for a way they might **fail forward**, meaning the story moves forward with a negative consequence rather than the failure halting progress entirely.
	- ### Special Circumstances 
		- If a PC is trying something that should be easier or harder than the rules would otherwise lead you to expect, give a circumstance bonus or penalty. The highest you should go is a +4/-4.
- ### Running Modes of Play 
	- Encounters take place in real time or slower, and they involve direct engagement between players and enemies, potential allies, or each other. **Combat and direct social interaction usually take place in encounter mode.**
	- Exploration used whenever characters are exploring a place where there's danger or uncertainty, such as an unfamiliar city or a dungeon. In exploration mode, characters aren't in immediate peril, but they must still be on their toes. Exploration and encounters are collectively called adventuring.
	- When the party isn't adventuring, the characters are in downtime. This mode covers most of a normal person's life, such as mundane, day-to-day tasks and working toward long-term goals.
	- #### Encounters 
		- Moderate to high stakes, structured time scale, actions and reactions are discrete. Reactions can occur in social situations, though their triggers are usually more descriptive and less tactical.
		- ##### Choosing Adversaries' Actions 
			- Most creatures have a basic grasp of simple tactics like flanking or focusing on a single target. But they still are emotional and make mistakes.
			- Running adversaries is a mix of being true to the creature and doing what’s best for the drama of the game.
		- ##### Social Encounters 
			- Most of the time, works best in free-form RP with one or two checks. Sometimes it's tense enough to warrant initiative. When doing so, establish stakes up front so players know the consequences of success and failure, and the circumstances that will cause the encounter to end. 
			- Things are more flexible here, you can extend the length of rounds.
			- ###### Initiative and Actions 
				- Typically roll Society or a Charisma-based skill. 
				- On player turns they RP what they say and do, then determine a roll for them to do. They attempt one roll, usually a skill action. 
				- Allow them to use any abilities or spells that might help them make their case, though keep in mind that when most people see the visual signs of a spell being cast, they think someone is using magic to try to influence or harm them, and they have a negative reaction.
				- Include an opposition in the encounter, whether direct like a rival or indirect like an unruly mob. 
			- ###### Measuring Success and Progress 
				- Chapter 4 has advice on setting DCs for social skill actions, often against a target's Will DC. On targets without stats, either pick a simple DC or use a level-based DC. (page 503) 
				- Attitude conditions: hostile, unfriendly, indifferent, friendly, and helpful. Can help track progress in the encounter.  
				- Give players an idea of progress as the encounter continues. Usually their goal is making someone friendly or making someone hostile calm.
				- There could be limited time frames. You might track number of successes and failures. 
		- Casting advantageous spells before a fight (sometimes called "pre-buffing") gives the characters a big advantage, since they can spend more combat rounds on offensive actions instead of preparatory ones. If the players have the drop on their foes, you usually can let each character cast one spell or prepare in some similar way, then roll initiative.
		- Casting preparatory spells before combat becomes a problem when it feels rote and the players assume it will always work—that sort of planning can't hold up in every situation! In many cases, the act of casting spells gives away the party's presence. In cases where the PCs' preparations could give them away, you might roll for initiative before everyone can complete their preparations.
	- #### Exploration
		- During exploration you’ll be making judgment calls on just about everything that happens.
		- Ask the players what they're doing during exploration. Their tasks can give them an edge or explain how combat begins.
		- It's really important to convey a clear mental picture of the group's surroundings. Encourage the players to explore. The things they try to do in exploration mode show you what they’re interested in and what they consider important.
		- Low to moderate stakes, time scale is typically faster than IRL, and you can speed up and slow down as needed. If you need a metric to work with, you can estimate time spent in exploration mode in 10-minute increments. 
		- Exploration activities assume the PCs are spending part of their time using actions, such as Seeking or Interacting. If they have specific actions they want to use, they should ask; you can decide whether the actions apply and whether to switch to encounter mode for greater detail. PCs can use any relevant reactions that come up during exploration mode.
		- ##### Exploration Activities 
			- Players describe what they're doing, you pick which action it fits. If it doesn't fit right, you determine how it works if the character's actions differ from those on the list.
			- The following sections discuss exploration activities that require adjudication from you beyond the guidelines for players detailed on pages 479–480 of Chapter 9.
			- ###### Detect Magic 
				- Hazards that require a minimum proficiency can't be found with *detect magic*, and illusions of equal or higher level can't be found either.
				- When they find something let them know and give them the chance to assess.
			- ###### Follow the Expert 
				- Usually, a character who is Following the Expert can't perform other exploration activities or follow more than one person at a time.
				- The initial result of Investigating is usually enough to give the investigator a clue that leads into a more thorough examination, but it rarely gives all possible information. 
			- ###### Search 
				- A successful Perception check doesn't provide a comprehensive catalog of everything there. It's a jumping-off point for closer inspection or an encounter. 
				- If an area contains too many objects or something that will take time to go through, they may need to stop for a complete search. 
				- You roll a secret Perception check for a [Searching](rules/actions/search.md) character to detect any secrets they pass that's in a place that stands out (such as near a door or a turn in a corridor), but not one that's in a more inconspicuous place (like a random point in a long hallway) unless they are searching particularly slowly and meticulously.
		- Hazards 
			- Simple - disarmed once. Complex hazards require encounter mode to handle. 
		- Rolling Initiative 
			- Reactions can happen before initiative.
			- You can allow a player to make a case that they should use a different skill than Perception, but only if they base it on something they’ve established beforehand.
		- ##### Resting 
			- A character who rests for 8 hours recovers in the following ways:
				- The character regains Hit Points equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum 1) multiplied by their level. If they rest without any shelter or comfort, you might reduce this healing by half (to a minimum of 1 HP).
				- The character loses the [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) condition.
				- The character reduces the severity of the [doomed](rules/conditions.md#Doomed) and [drained](rules/conditions.md#Drained) conditions by 1.
				- Most spellcasters need to rest before they regain their spells for the day.
			- The 8 hours don't need to be consecutive.
			- ###### Watches and Surprise attacks 
				- If a surprise encounter would occur during rest, you can roll a die to randomly determine which character is on watch at the time. All characters roll initiative; sleeping characters typically roll Perception with a –4 status penalty for being unconscious. They don't automatically wake up when rolling initiative, but they might roll a Perception check to wake up at the start of their turn due to noise. If a savvy enemy waits for a particularly vulnerable character to take watch before attacking, the attack can happen on that character's watch automatically. However, you might have the ambusher attempt a [Stealth](compendium/skills.md#Stealth) check against the Perception DCs of all characters to see if anyone noticed its approach.
			- ###### Starvation and Thirst 
				- Typically characters eat and drink enough to survive comfortably. When they can’t, they’re fatigued until they do. Without water, after a number of days equal to a creature’s Constitution modifier + 1, the creature takes 1d4 damage each hour that can’t be healed until it quenches its thirst. After the same amount of time without food, it takes 1 damage each day that can’t be healed until it eats.
	- #### Downtime
		- Usually, downtime is a few minutes at the start of a session or a break between major chapters of an adventure.
		- No to low stakes, can last days, weeks, months, years. If you need to use actions or reactions switch to exploration or encounter mode. 
		- ##### Playing out a downtime day 
			- Start by asking what the players are doing 
			- Handle the simplest ones first. Potentially allow those players to take breaks while you handle the more complicated ones. 
			- Have players set a normal daily preparation routine to stick to unless they say otherwise.  
			- ###### Cooperation 
				- If it's a simple task, have one person roll and other Aid them. If it's complex, assume each of them is working on a separate piece of the goal. 
			- ###### Checks 
				- Because these rolls represent the culmination of a series of tasks over a long period, players can't use most abilities or spells that manipulate die rolls, such as activating a magic item to gain a bonus or casting a fortune spell to roll twice. Constant benefits still apply, though, so someone might invest a magic item that gives them a bonus without requiring activation. Something like [[assurance|Assurance]] would work still. 
- ### Difficulty Classes 
	- #### Simple DCs 
		- ![[chapter-10-game-mastering#Simple DCs]]
	- #### Level Based DCs 
		- ![[chapter-10-game-mastering#Level-Based DCs]]
	- #### Adjusting Difficulty
		- Most often used on tasks whose DCs are based on their level. 
		- ![[dc-adjustments|DC Adjustments]]
		- Consider having different DCs for the use of different skills on a particular task if it's applicable. 
	- #### Group Attempts 
		- When a task is something that everyone can attempt and you still want it to be a challenge. Make it a very hard check.
	- #### Minimum Proficiency 
		- Sometimes succeeding at a particular task requires a character to have a specific proficiency rank in addition to a success on the check. Locks and traps often require a certain proficiency rank to successfully use the Pick a Lock or Disable a Device actions of [Thievery](compendium/skills.md#Thievery). A character whose proficiency rank is lower than what's listed can attempt the check, but they can't succeed. You can apply similar minimum proficiencies to other tasks. You might decide, for example, that a particular arcane theorem requires training in [Arcana](compendium/skills.md#Arcana) to understand. An untrained barbarian can't succeed at the check, but she can still attempt it if she wants—after all, she needs to have a chance to critically fail and get erroneous information!
		- For checks that require a minimum proficiency, keep the following guidelines in mind. A 2nd-level or lower task should almost never require expert proficiency, a 6th-level or lower task should almost never require master proficiency, and a 14th-level or lower task should almost never require legendary proficiency. If they did, no character of the appropriate level could succeed.
	- #### Specific Actions 
		- ##### Craft 
			- Level based DC using item level. Adjustment based on rarity. Possibly add an 'easy' DC adjustment if they've made it before.
			- Repairing usually uses the DC of the item's level with no adjustments.
		- ##### Earn Income 
			- You set the task level when someone tries to Earn Income. The highest-level task available is usually the same as the level of the settlement where the character is located. If you don’t know the settlement’s level, it’s usually 0–1 for a village, 2–4 for a town, or 5–7 for a city. A capital or metropolis could be 8-10, and beyond that would be in the largest cities in the world, or in extraplanar locales. Some settlements could have specific higher level tasks available due to the nature of the settlement. Eg. a major port having higher level tasks for Sailing Lore, etc. 
			- Once the player has chosen one of the tasks (having known the level of all tasks) then you set the DC based on the level. You can adjust based of any reasonable factors you wish.
		- ##### Gather Information 
			- Simple DC, adjust upward if they want specific details. 
		- ##### Identify Magic or Learn a Spell 
			- Level based DC for the item or spell. Adjust for rarity.
			- For cursed items and illusory items, raise the DC with the incredibly hard DC adjustment, to increase the chance of misidentification.
		- ##### Recall Knowledge 
			- On most topics, simple DCs. If the topic is something with a level, like a creature, trap etc, use level-based DC. Adjust for rarity.
			- If they want to keep going for more checks after a success, increase the difficulty by a step. Once they've attempted an incredibly hard check, they've recalled everything that they know.
			- ![[chapter-10-game-mastering#Creature Identification]]
			- ##### Sense Direction 
				- simple DC. trained in normal wilderness, expert in deep forest or underground. Master in featureless or tricky locations, or legendary in weird or surreal environments on other planes. 
			- ##### Social Skills 
				- When using Charisma skills on someone whose level or Will DC you don't know, estimate their level and use that DC. 
			- ##### Subsist 
				- Simple DC 
			- ##### Track 
				- Simple DC and adjust it
			- ##### Train an Animal 
				- Level of animal as baseline. Adjust up for difficult tricks, and down if the animal is domesticated.
## Crafting & Treasure
- Rarity does not equal power, it's about lore and availability
- You can benefit from no more than 10 invested magic items each day. 
- The mechanics behind using items is very similar to that of spells. 
- Crafting is about availability, making what you need and want. It intentional that it isn't cheaper than buying items. To make it a bit more fun, include some extra uncommon crafting recipes in loot.
- When making items, a character can Craft only items whose level is equal to or lower than their own.
- Players typically buy items for pull Price and sell for half-price. 
- Unless stated otherwise, creating items of 9th level and higher requires you to have the master proficiency rank in Crafting, and items of 16th level and higher require legendary Crafting.
- creating alchemical items requires the Alchemical Crafting feat (page 258), creating magic items requires the Magical Crafting feat (page 263), and crafting snares requires the Snare Crafting feat (page 266).
- GMs may allow you to craft permanent items from lower-level versions of the same item.
- For poisoned weapons, if you crit fail on your Strike with one the poison is spent.
- Scrolls and wands cannot hold cantrips, focus spells, or rituals.
- *Scrolls and wands* both work almost the same. They 
	- hold a spell at a set level, 
	- they replace the costs of spells but not a focus if a spell needs one (like plane shift needs a tuning fork), 
	- you need to have the spell on your spell list to use them, 
	- and the spell is cast with your spell attack bonus and spell DC. 
- The key difference is that wands are usable once per day, while scrolls are one time use items. Wands can be overcharged to use them an extra time at risk of destroying them. 
- For staves, you must have the spell on your list and you must spend charges on it, but on top of that *you must also be able to to cast spells at the same spell level to cast those spells*. 
	- The number charges required for a spell = the level of the spell. Cantrips are free, and heighten like normal.
	- During daily prep you can bond with only 1 staff and grant it charges equal to your highest level spell slot. This costs you nothing. The charges don't get stored for the next day. 
	- Staves don't replace the costs of spells.
	- Staves are melee weapons and can have fundamental runes on them, but not property runes.
	- During daily prep, *prepared* casters can spend 1 spell slot to give the staff extra charges = to spell slot's level.
	- *Spontaneous* casters can casts spells from a staff's repertoire using only 1 charge, but they have to spend one of their own spell slots of equal or greater level to do so.
## Conditions 
- #### Groups of Conditions 
	- Degrees of Detection: Observed, hidden, undetected, unnoticed
	- Senses: Blinded, concealed, dazzled, deafened, invisible 
	- Death and Dying: Doomed, dying, unconscious, wounded 
	- Attitudes: Hostile, unfriendly, indifferent, friendly, helpful 
	- Lowered Abilities: Clumsy, drained, enfeebled, stupefied
- Blinded overrides dazzled
- Effects that make items broken drop their current HP to the Broken Threshold.
- You can still be observed with Concealed. They need a DC 5 flat check to target you. 
- Every instance of damage that you take could end Confused on a DC 11 flat check.
- Being Deafened can make you fail at doing actions with the auditory trait.
- Doomed value goes down by one each full night's rest. Doomed reduces your maximum dying value. 
- Drained value goes down by one each full night's rest.
- Dying 4 is where you die. 
- When you drop to 0, your initiative moves to right before the creature or effect that reduced you to 0.
- Remember that you can be flat footed to one creature, certain attacks, or everyone/thing.
- Frightened decreases by one at the end of each of your turns. 
- Grabbed makes you Flat-Footed and Immobilized. Manipulate actions require a flat check. If you fail you lose the action.
- Persistent damage does get doubled or halved based on the results of attack rolls and saving throws. 
- Persistent damage happens at the end of your turns. After you take it, roll a DC 15 flat check to see if you recover from it. 
- Prone makes you flat-footed and gives you a -2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls. It does let you Take Cover without an object to get behind. 
- 

## House Rules
- I'm allowing bucklers to be Raised while holding light objects in the same hand.
- I'm allowing reloading of items that take 2 or more actions to reload to be split up over multiple turns as needed (so they aren't an activity that must be completed on one turn)
- Recall Knowledge is a little tricky. I'm bringing in the change from the remaster. Success lets you ask a question, Critical success is 2 questions. You can ask what a creature's lowest save is, but not the specific number. Also, features, resistances, and weaknesses are useful to question. I'm also not using the higher DCs for repeated checks. 
- Another change from the refactor - The Refocus action is no longer limited in how many times you can use it per rest and get a benefit. So it's just "Spend 10 minutes chilling, get 1 Focus Point back." Simple as.
- The game assumes you have both health and resources full at the beginning of an encounter.
- Maybe the new Ashen runes will be lore-specific and exclusive for reasons... 
- Award more Hero points!
- Keep sessions around 3-3.5 hours, with a wrap up chat at the end. 
	- Great time for players to ask "Why did this happen?" or "How do we do X?" etc.
- Treat social interactions as if players are always [Following the Expert](https://2e.aonprd.com/Activities.aspx?ID=4) on whoever has the highest relevant skill.
- Watch out for people interrupting, and make sure if you put someone on hold - get back to them at some point.

4. Incapacitation spells - 1 level higher
5. Potential Massive Damage on a crit - 1 level higher

## GameMastery Guide 
### Chapter 1
#### General Advice 
- Pacing - have lulls and gaps between high pressure situations. Figure out how you want a session to end around 20 minutes before the time comes.
- Stakes and Consequences - have a variety of stakes in scenes. Consequences should be specific and evocative. Let the characters *witness* these in the world. Consequences should be foreseeable in at least a general sense. 
- Failing Forward - Fewer dead ends. A failure might still give useful information, reveal how to improve chances next time, or cause unforeseen difficulties.
- Improvisation 
	- Ask the following questions: 
		- Does something already established in our story so far tell me what should happen here?
		- If an NPC is involved, what would their personality lead them to do?
		- What does the player expect to happen?
		- What would best fit the themes of our story?
	- Feel free to call a short break to develop something significant.
- False Information - The consequences should be soon and not major. Remember that they get incorrect info, not important-seeming false info.  
#### Running Encounters (pg 10)
- As GM focus on:
	- Answering questions quickly and decisively whenever possible.
	- Building anticipation for what happens next.
	- Emphasizing thrilling action and setting a rapid pace.
	- Letting players know when they’re up, and preferably when they’re “on deck” to go next.
	- Showing the immediate consequences of actions.
##### Initiative 
- Stealth 
	- Anyone who's Avoiding Notice makes a Stealth check for initiative. Include cover bonuses for initiative. If they roll Perception instead, then they are certainly detected. 
	- They are undetected by everyone who's Perception DC they meet or exceed.
	- If someone rolls well on initiative with Perception, but everyone against them beat their Perception DC with their Stealth rolls, then the enemies are undetected, but not unnoticed. So the first person knows that someone is around and can start Seeking for them, etc.
##### Ad Hoc Bonuses & Penalties 
- Sometimes changing enemy behaviour is a better reward than a bonus.
- Use bonuses more than penalties.
- For penalties, look at terrain or environment, ideally it's something the character would have expected.
##### Adjudicating Actions 
- For options that are either/or (like if someone can Take Cover or Aid), tell them before they spend time, actions or resources trying, in most cases the PC can usually determine such. If the PC wouldn't know, that is an exception.
- Aid - It needs a reason that's good enough to actually do something. They need to be in the right place to do so and usually take an appropriate amount of time. 
- Ready - Needs to be based on something the *character* can observe in the world, not a rules concept.
- Seek - How long it takes is up to you. The main distinction is if it takes 3 actions or less versus if it takes longer. 
- Sense Motive - Try to convey the info indirectly, ie body language, sweating and details. Sometimes on a crit success, just say they're lying. You also might need to determine when the situation changes enough for someone to try to Sense Motive again. Typically they need to receive new evidence that something is out of the ordinary to make another check. 
- Take Cover - You decide if they can, usually they just need something large enough to hide behind. It might require them to [[drop-prone|Drop Prone]], but you can add that into the Take Cover action instead of it being 2 separate ones.
##### Maps and Minis 
- There's still room for improvisation. Eg. Running downhill could grant 5 extra feet of movement.
- Cover - You determine if they have cover. Concider the environment and use your own discretion. Be generous to PCs who use creativity to get into smart positions, especially if they spend actions on it. 
- Splitting and Combining Movement - if you want to, you can allow players to combine movement actions in ways that are fluid and don't take up too many actions. Like if they need to move 10 feet before making a Leap, you could combine them and allow them to use the rest of their normal Stride movement.
##### Special Battles and Movement 
- Mounted Combat - Make sure there's space for them to move, maybe include some areas too small for the mounts, so those on foot can get a tactical advantage to offset the opponent's greater mobility. Enemies should focus on mounted PCs, not their mounts. 
- Aquatic Combat - Don't have enemies dispel their breathing magic too much. You might rule that having one side of a combat in water when the other isn't grants concealment both ways.
##### Social Encounters 
- Page 494 of the CRB. Social NPCs on GMG pg 72-73. Victory Points could be used, or the Influence subsystem.
- Flexible time scale. Usually enough time for a participant to make one salient point and make one check before moving on.
- A list of possible social encounters:
	- Besting a rival bard in a battle of wits
	- Brokering peace between warring groups
	- Convincing a dragon not to eat the party
	- Convincing a monarch to defend against an invasion
	- Disproving a rival’s scientific theories before an alchemists’ guild assembly
	- Ending a tense standoff
	- Exposing a slippery villain’s deception before a court of nobles
	- Getting a desperate criminal to free a hostage
	- Persuading a clan to trust their ancient rivals
	- Petitioning for admittance to a magical academy
	- Proving someone’s innocence in front of a judge 
	- Securing a major contract over a rival
	- Quelling an angry mob
	- Swaying a fallen priest to return to the faith
	- Tricking a charlatan into contradicting their past lies
	- Turning a leader against their corrupted advisor
	- Turning a low-ranking cultists against their leader
	- Urging a lawmaker to grant clemency or a stay of execution
	- Wining a debate about a contentious topic
#### Running Exploration (pg 17)
- CRB pg 496
- Keep these in mind
	- Evoke the setting with **sensory details**.
	- Shift the passage of **time** to emphasize tension and uncertainty, and speed past uneventful intervals.
	- Get players to add details by asking for their **reactions**.
	- Present small-scale **mysteries** to intrigue players and spur investigation.
	- When rolls are needed, look for ways to move the action forward or add interesting wrinkles on a failure.
	- Plan effective **transitions** to encounters.
- Appeal to senses, foreshadow. Try to emphasize new details. 
- Measure time in 10-minute increments or longer periods of time. Use montages to pass through time quickly, add more details during traps and scenes where precision pays off.
##### Exploration Activites 
- Their purpose is to clarify what each PC is focusing on. Add variety to their behaviour and show you where the players want the story to go. 
- For continual exploration activities, get details from the players on how they do them. If they want to do multiple, ask them which is most important. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of various activities in the current situation. Scouting on thin ice, failing on investigating some glyphs - leading the party the wrong direction, etc.
- For discrete actions that happen quickly or during a rest like Treat Wounds, remember that the PCs can switch to this easily and right back to a continual one. They can change activities at any time. 
- ##### Searching 
	- It takes as long as you say it does. If the party has the time to search thoroughly without danger, consider letting them auto-succeed. Or roll for how long it takes. Thorough searching in a dungeon can draw attention. If they want to search again, have them describe what they do differently. Just saying "I search it again" isn't enough, but be generous with what you allow, as long as the player puts thought into it!
- ##### Follow the Expert 
	- Descriptions from the players are key. If they're doing the same thing repeatedly, it could be treated like working toward a [[retraining]]. 
- ##### Improvising New Activities  
	- Compare the amount of actions with other activities to tell if it is something that could be done indefinitely or not. Keep in mind the advantages and disadvantages of the new activity. Think about what they're neglecting to do it. If it seems to always be the best, rebalance.
##### Scenes within Exploration
- Describe the transition between scenes. Your level of detail should set the expectation of the scene's depth.
- Investigate - Lead with a clue that doesn't tell everything. If players intereted, go into a more detailed investigation. Avoid unnecessary checks. Talk through the character's thought processes by saying what clue inspired them to think of an important detail, explaining what the detail is, and possibly mentioning a further question that detail raises. Then let the player extrapolate rather than telling them their conclusion. 
##### Getting Lost 
- Sense Direction uses Survival to find north. Recall Knowledge about the area to get your bearings. Typically Trained or Expert DCs. 
- Give them notable landmarks.  If they're truly lost have someone meet them, good or bad.
##### Surprise Attacks 
 - To be used sparingly. CRB pg 499. They're more likely if the PCs prompt them. Assume that the party sets up watch plenty when possible. 
#### Running Downtime (pg 22)
- CRB 500
- You can use Downtime to:
	- Demonstrate changes to the setting that result from the PCs' previous achievements, giving them time to breathe and appreciate what they've accomplished.
	- Emphasize the PCs' planning and the fruit it bears.
	- Avoid bogging the game down, even if a great deal of time passes. Keep the number of rolls small.
	- Bring back compelling NPCs or plot threads established in previous downtime or adventures.
	- Interject interesting events and scenes related to what the PCs do to make the world feel more alive.
	- Switch to encounter or exploration more as needed when actions spur a new scene or adventure.
##### Depth Of Downtime 
- Shouldn't take full sessions. 15-30 minutes of IRL time. Adjust as needed.
- ##### Group Engagement 
- When you can, combine multiple people's tasks into one. Or they can help each other more directly with Aid.
- ##### Campaigns without Downtime 
- Usually happens due to lack of time or no interest. Skipping downtime usually wont require adjusting your game, since the money they earn from it is minor compared to adventuring. The PCs will have less choice in what items they get if they don't Craft or earn that extra money to buy them though. 
##### Long-Term Goals 
- More satisfying than disconnected tasks. Ask PCs for goals to build storylines they're interested in.
##### Buying and Selling 
- Town and large size settlements typically have at least one vendor with common gear, magic and alchemical items of 1st level. 
- Examples of ways to lay out markets. Easy access everywhere, lots of access with research required, or nearly nonexistant.
##### Tasks and Events 
Various ideas for earning income. 
[EARN INCOME TASKS](rules/tables/earn-income-tasks-gmg.md)
Downtime Events 
[DOWNTIME EVENTS](rules/tables/downtime-events-gmg.md)
##### Money in Downtime 
- Tracking cost of living is best used for months and years of downtime. Ignore it for a short bursts, unless a PC is RPing a fine or extravagant lifestyle.
- Investments - the downtime system isn't meant to deal with investing money for receiving interest or making more money. It's better used for setting up changes in the world. Founding a museum, etc. 
##### Retraining 
- Your primary responsibility here is to determine the time, instruction, and costs of retraining, as well as adjusting details to align cohesively with the story and world.
- ###### Teachers 
	-  Archwizard Koda Mohanz, wizard academy proctor
	- Bagra Redforge, aged artisan
	- Baroness Ivestia II, tutor in etiquette and social maneuvering
	- Byren Effestos, Esquire, advisor in matters of law, politics, and finance
	- Dr. Phinella Albor, professor of medicine and surgery
	- Dr. Revis Enzerrad, mystic versed in the occult
	- Grita the Swamp Sage, purveyor of strange draughts and cryptic riddles
	- Jeballewn Leastfire, tutor in alchemical experimentation
	- Kpunde Neverlost, retired veteran adventurer
	- Lyra, teller of legends and master of handicrafts
	- Major Venaeus, instructor of military tactics
	- Mother Elizia, high priest and religious scholar
	- Professor Kurid Yamarrupan, senior university lector
	- Quintari Solvar, coach for fitness and healthy living
	- Ragged Sanden, hermit and speaker for nature
	- Silent Flame, Master of the Seventeen Forms
	- Tembly the Daring, veteran acrobat and circus performer
	- Twelve Fingers, experienced thief and spy
	- Wen Hardfoot, well-traveled scout and naturalist
	- Zuleri Gan, conductor, playwright, and music scholar.
- By the default rules, PCs can't retrain their class, ancestry, background, ability boosts, or anything else intrinsic to their character. You can make that work in your story though.
#### Narrative Collaboration (page 32)
- 3 methods 
- ##### Idea Farm 
- ##### Creative Collaboration 
- Everyone takes a part that interest them and works on it. Running Monsters, Stats of NPCs, maps and locations, etc.
- ##### Decentralized Stories- 
#### Campaign Structure (page 36)
- ##### Selling Items 
	- It's expected that a Pathfinder campaign strives for some amount of verisimilitude—that PCs can't find a buyer for every item, especially if they're selling multiple copies of the same thing. Players should not have the expectation that they can sell whatever they want whenever they want. They might be unable to sell items that wouldn't be in demand, have to take a lower percentage, or have trouble selling items in places without massive wealth.
	- You can do without this, and allow them to sell anything for half Price anywhere.
#### Encounter Design (page 46) 
- Encounter design goes hand in hand with location, map, and adventure design.
- Expanding on CRB pg 489. 
##### Variety 
- Vary on theme, difficulty, complexity, composition (# of enemies), setup, and information.
##### Encounter Locations 
- The most significant environmental features shold come from the occupants, past and present.
- Sometimes a location is tied to an enemy so they always appear there, sometimes it's a wandering monster. In those cases you need several terrain and structure options to keep the environment interesting. 
- ###### Maps and Terrain
- Three considerations to keep in mind when designing a map are maneuverability, line of sight, and attack ranges.
- To make large rooms more interesting, add cover. 
- NPCs and monsters who live in an area are likely to be adapted to its dangers, either because they know where they are and how to avoid them, or because they are unaffected by them. When using creatures with burrow, climb or swim speeds, consider adding features that let them use their advantages. eg. mazelike corridors, high walls with platforms, or rivers.
- If there's a size difference, that can be used too.
- Don't forget weather outdoors 
- If the terrain is significant enough to pose a real challenge, include it in the encounter budget. 
##### Dynamic Encounters 
- Hazards in Combat 
- Evolving Battlefields 
##### Social Encounters 
- The setup for a social encounter tends to be less detailed. For the NPCs involved, you'll just need statistics for their social skills, [Perception](compendium/skills.md#Perception), and Will. If you're making your own, you can find guidelines under Non-Combat Level on page 72.
### Chapter 2
#### Relics (page 94)

#### Settlements (page 132) 
- Virtually every settlement uses the rules for urban environments presented starting on page 514 of the _Pathfinder Core Rulebook_. Though that's mostly encounter mode.
##### Settlement Adventures 
- Influence and reputation subsystems (GMG pg 151, 154) can help for social encounters. Chase scenes (GMG pg 156) can be fun. Infiltration (GMG pg 160) can happen, research rules (GMG 154) can be utilized, and PCs can build up their own organizations with the leadership subsystem. 
- Most time is usually spent in exploration mode here. 
##### Marketplaces 
- Buying and Selling (GMG 24) for commerce. In a given settlement, a character can usually purchase any common item (including formulas, alchemical items, and magic items) that is of the same or lower level than the settlement's. Usually, fewer of the highest-level items are available.
- People in a settlement can usually purchase items from PCs that are the same or lower level than the settlement.
- PCs that are a higher level than the settlement can convince them to place orders for higher level items and do custom work, but it may take more time.
- [[spellcasting-services|Spellcasting Services]] are available in many settlements. A character can find someone to cast common spells up to a level that could be cast by an NPC of the settlement's level. For example, a character in a 9th-level city can typically find and pay someone to cast a 5th-level common spell—the highest spell available to a 9th-level spellcaster.
- Some settlements will have access to uncommon items, formulas, and spells. In such places, they could be available as a common item.
##### Power Structures
- ###### Government
- Often reflects the nature of the settlement. Could be a front for something or someone else. 
- ###### Legal Codes 
- Could fewer and simpler, or more numerous, convoluted and complex. How well-documented they are varies too. 
- ###### Law Enforcement 
- Most settlements have some way of dealing with criminals, from fines to public stocks to prison cells, as well as individuals responsible for meting out those sentences.
- ###### Organizations, Churches, and Factions
- Prestigious organizations, prominent churches, and specialized factions all wield power as well, often in conflict with the official government or one another. This can be overt or subtle control. Other notable factions may include noble houses, wealthy merchants, innkeepers, and retired soldiers and adventurers.
> [!tip]- COMMON NPCS
> Several categories of NPCs are quite common in settlements, if not exclusive to them. The following sections from the NPC Gallery of this book provide statistics and additional useful information for running settlements.
> - **Courtiers** (page 206) The upper crust of society is most common in larger settlements.
>- **Magistrates** (page 224) These public officials create and implement the law.
>- **Officers** (page 232) Officers are responsible for enforcing the law in a settlement.
>- **Performers** (page 236) Performers are most common in settlements, where there are large audiences.
>- **Publicans** (page 238) Nearly every settlement has at least one gathering place and its regulars.
>- **Scholars** (page 240) Most repositories of lore are located within settlements.
>- **Tradespeople** (page 244) Tradespeople provide the skilled labor that keeps a town supplied and running.
##### Settlement Stat Block (page 134)
- Level represents relative size and economic capacity. Generally, the max level of NPC in the area, as well as common items available. Also the max task level available to Earn Income. 
- For type, that tends to correlate to settlement's level. Village is 0-1, town 2-4, City 5-7, metropolis 8+. Though enough high level or wealthy people in a place could skew it higher.
- A settlement could have other traits based on it's focus or population. A dwarven sky citadel could have the dwarf trait, since it was built and occupied by them. A place focused on a prestigious university could have the academic trait, etc. These can have mechanical effects, like what items are found here, bonuses on some checks if you follow the same religion, making it easier to find information or learn spells, etc.
- These can also be changed to reflect the impact of the PCs actions. For example, if the party (using the leadership subsystem on page 168) built up a wizard school focused on crafting magical items, you might add an ability to the settlement stat block that increased the availability of magic items in the settlement's markets.
