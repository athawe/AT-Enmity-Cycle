# Effect: Hunter's Brooch
## Level 4
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Hunter's Brooch|Hunter's Brooch]]

By touching a weapon you wield to the symbol and uttering a plea for Erastil's steadying hand, you grant that weapon the deadly d12 trait. Against undead, the weapon instead gains the fatal d12 trait. This blessing lasts for 1 minute, until you score a critical hit with the weapon, or until you aren't wielding the weapon.
