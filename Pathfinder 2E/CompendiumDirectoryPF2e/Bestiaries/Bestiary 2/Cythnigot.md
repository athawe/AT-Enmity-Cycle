The cythnigot is a foul fungal parasite that grows and thrives in the corpses of small creatures. It wears these bodies like a suit, but also adjusts and tailors the fleshy covering to suit its needs, and the body ends up looking as alien as anything else spawned from the Abyssal depths. The cythnigot's most identifying feature is the long stalk of fungal material that extends from creature's body, ending in a surprisingly strong set of fanged jaws.
