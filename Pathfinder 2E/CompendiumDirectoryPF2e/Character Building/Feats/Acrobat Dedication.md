You become an expert in Acrobatics. At 7th level, you become a master in Acrobatics, and at 15th level, you become legendary in Acrobatics.

Whenever you critically succeed at an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] an enemy's space, you don't treat the enemy's space as difficult terrain.
