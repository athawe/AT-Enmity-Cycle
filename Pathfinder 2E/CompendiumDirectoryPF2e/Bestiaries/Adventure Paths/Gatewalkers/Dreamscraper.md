Dreamscrapers invade the dreams of sleeping mortals to scrape away at their minds and steal their dreams, leaving them raw and tired upon waking. Maggot-like, with many eyes surrounded by a circular, toothy mouth, dreamscrapers use sharp barbs attached to ethereal tendrils to trawl for dreams. After returning to the Dimension of Dreams with their prizes, they store them in their dark, spire-like cocoons, trade them, or offer them up to their heinous masters as some obscure tax.

Although many dreamscrapers act as servants for more powerful creatures, some act independently. Unable to dream themselves, their fascination leads them to experiment with their collections. They attempt to either synthesize dreams of their own or implant collected dreams within themselves.

### Dream collections

Dreams are fascinating creations of the imagination that many powerful entities seek to collect. Liches, for example, are intrigued by the dreams of mortals. Night hags and denizens of Leng see dreams as a valuable commodity, and their bartering draws many beings to the shadowy markets of Leng.
