If the target fails and wasn't already affected by the wasting curse, the baykok gains 20 temporary Hit Points that last for 1 hour."

    desc: " (curse,occult) The baykok steals life from its victim and leaves listless dread in its place.\n\nIf a target fails its save against Devour Life, it becomes [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 1]].\n\nEach time the target gets a full night's rest, it must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude check save or its drained value increases rather than decreasing. The curse ends if the creature recovers from the drained condition, but if the creature would reach drained 5 from this effect, it dies."

A baykok is the restless remnant of a warrior or hunter, cast out for evil acts and cursed to forever soar through the sky far from its home, unable to ever set foot on the ground again. The creature's despairing, lonely cries at night are audible for miles across the wilderness it haunts. Jealous rage drives it to hunt isolated humanoids, especially warriors and hunters who remind it of the life it once had and squandered. A baykok's invisible arrows carry its soul-freezing loneliness, and its envious touch can steal a helpless victim's vitality.
