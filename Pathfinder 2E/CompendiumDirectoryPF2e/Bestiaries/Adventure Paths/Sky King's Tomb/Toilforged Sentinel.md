Toilforged sentinels are intelligent war machines painstakingly constructed from iron, steel, and other metals over the course of a full year. With twin treads, a central cage filled with eternal flames, and numerous weapons (including a hammer, cannon, and grasping claw capable of snatching up foes), a toilforged sentinel is an intimidating sight. Creatures consumed by a sentinel's flames become captives, their souls eternally bound to the flames, powering the device. Such souls are freed upon the sentinel's destruction.

## Salvation

Toilforged sentinels are religious constructs created to destroy heretics: those who refuse to worship Droskar. They take orders only from the clergy of Droskar and find particular satisfaction from consuming worshippers of Torag and other dwarven deities.
