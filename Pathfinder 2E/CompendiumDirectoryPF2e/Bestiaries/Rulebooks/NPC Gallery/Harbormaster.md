There are three flows important to any port: the seaward and coastal flows, marked by the rise and fall of the tides, and the flow of trade. A harbormaster is expected to know the former two reflexively and encourage the latter while knowing jurisdictional rules of law. Often old hands of the sea, harbormasters find themselves anchored to a port by commitment, conflict, or reputation.
