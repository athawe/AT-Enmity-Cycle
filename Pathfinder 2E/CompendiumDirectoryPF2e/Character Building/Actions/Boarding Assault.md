# Boarding Assault `pf2:2`

### [[flourish]]

**Category** offensive; 




Either Stride twice or attempt an Acrobatics check (DC determined by the GM, but usually DC 20) to swing on a rope up to twice your Speed.

If you boarded or disembarked from a boat or similar vehicle during this movement, you can make a melee Strike that deals one additional weapon damage die.
