# Violent Unleash `pf2:0`
## Feat 4
### [[mindshift]][[occult]][[psychic]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** You Unleash your Psyche.

* * *

The force of your mind unleashing itself wracks your enemies with a violent shockwave. You deal 1d6 force damage to all creatures in a 20-foot emanation, with a basic Reflex save. This explosion is taxing, making you [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 1]]. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d6.
