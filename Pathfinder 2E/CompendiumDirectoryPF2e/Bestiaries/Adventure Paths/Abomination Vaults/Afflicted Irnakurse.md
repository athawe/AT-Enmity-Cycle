Irnakurse are surface elves who drow have subjected to particularly cruel and humiliating fleshwarping practices, as drow take special delight in the torment of their surface-dwelling kin. The process of crafting an irnakurse involves twisting an unfortunate elf into a deformed mass of misplaced limbs, loose flesh, and bony protrusions-parts that should be internal are often left on full display to the world. Irnakurse are subject to mental conditioning that causes them to hate their prior forms, and these creatures prefer to attack surface elves over all other targets.

* * *

Horrid abominations reshaped by vile alchemical magic, the two fleshwarps presented here were created by drow, who transform captured elves or xulgaths into twisted monstrosities that can then be loosed to cause havoc and terror.
