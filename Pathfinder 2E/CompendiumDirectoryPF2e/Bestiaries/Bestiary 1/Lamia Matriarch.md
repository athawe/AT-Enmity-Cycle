The brilliant and powerful lamia matriarchs possess boundless ambition, always seeking to bring more people and territory into the clutches of their kind. Consequently, the become rulers of other lamia. For all their cruelty toward other creatures, they're fierce protectors of other lamia, and consequently they quickly come to rule cults or warbands. Regardless of the lamia's gender, these ascended lamias are always known as matriarchs. Rather than leonine limbs, a lamia matriarch's lower body is formed in the winding coils of a giant snake. They're also set apart by the occult power they pursue, and some have even have grand designs to break the animalistic curse that transformed them. However, every attempt so far has led to the matriarch's fall.

* * *

Lamias are bloodthirsty victims of an ancient curse for which they blame the gods. Most lamias are humanoid from the waist up but have the lower bodies of beasts and monsters. Sinister magic comes naturally to a lamia, and they prefer the use of illusions and enchantments to deceive prey for later consumption, or simply to torture.
