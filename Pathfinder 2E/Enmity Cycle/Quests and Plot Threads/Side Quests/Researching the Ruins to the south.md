	- [ ]  History: El-Amara was once the provincial capital of Thuvia, when Thuvia was still part of the Ancient Osirion. It was abandoned and fell to ruin when pharaohs started to ignore their distant vassal state. It was in el-Amara that [High Theurgist Fentet-Pesu](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Fentet-Pesu "Fentet-Pesu"), the last Osirian governor of Thuvia, was assassinated in [-841 AR](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/-841_AR "-841 AR"). Since its fall, few had visited the half-buried spires and crumbling bell towers of el-Amara, until a few centuries ago when disciples of [Ahriman](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ahriman "Ahriman") took to the ruins to establish a base near Osirion. Currently el-Amara is populated by [sepid divs](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sepid "Sepid") led by general [Karesh-Ekhial](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Karesh-Ekhial "Karesh-Ekhial") and hordes of [ghul](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ghul "Ghul") thralls.

Simply asking around to Gather Information is an excellent way to learn more about the sites; each attempt to do so takes 2 hours of work. Alternatively, a PC can attempt to Recall Information about them on their own. Finally, Hakren Zost’s collection of lore likely holds additional secrets; these checks take 1 hour.
