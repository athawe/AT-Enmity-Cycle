Fetch quests for materials (flowers for dye, cactus milk for alchemy)
- If the party gets more than a few of these for [[Hannah Velerin]] @ [[Hannah's Herbs]], she's willing to tell them about her privately cultivated patch of pesh south of Lamasara. She managed to set it up while she was on an expedition down there years ago, and she thinks there's enough there to harvest by now.
