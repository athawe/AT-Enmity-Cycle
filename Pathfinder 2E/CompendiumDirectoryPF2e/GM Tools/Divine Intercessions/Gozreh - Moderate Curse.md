# Gozreh - Moderate Curse

### 

**Category** curse; 




**Moderate Curse** The current of the waves constantly fights against you, putting you at risk of drowning any time you must Swim.

You lose any [[Actions/Swim|Swim]] Speed you have, unless it's your only Speed, in which case you take a -20-foot status penalty to your swim Speed.

When you roll an Athletics check to [[Actions/Swim|Swim]], you always use the outcome for one degree of success worse than the result of your roll.
