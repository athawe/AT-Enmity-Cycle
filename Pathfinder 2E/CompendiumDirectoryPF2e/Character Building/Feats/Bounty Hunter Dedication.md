# Bounty Hunter Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Survival
* * *
When focused on finding your quarry, you're relentless. You gain the [[Actions/Hunt Prey|Hunt Prey]] action. You can use Hunt Prey to designate only a creature that you've seen, heard about, or learned about through some other means, such as a bounty board or wanted poster. In addition to the other benefits of Hunt Prey, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to [[Actions/Gather Information|Gather Information]] regarding your prey.

If you already have Hunt Prey, you become an expert in Survival and gain the circumstance bonus to Gather Information about your prey; you can still designate a creature you're tracking during exploration, in addition to the conditions above.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Bounty Hunter|Bounty Hunter]] archetype.
