Selfish and crude, these rough-skinned raiders are bullies and ultimately cowards. Quick-tempered and fond of violence, a hill giant gladly raids and pillages the defenseless but is quick to flee from those who are bigger, stronger, or better organized than they are. A hill giant is never above shoving or tricking one of their own kind to slow down their opponent or get the best loot.

Giants are massive humanoid creatures who live in remote regions throughout the world. They are divided into a number of subtypes.
