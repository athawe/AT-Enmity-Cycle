# Spell Effect: Mantle of the Magma Heart (Enlarging Eruption)
## Level 5
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Mantle of the Magma Heart|Mantle of the Magma Heart]]

You surround yourself in a mantle of blazing fire magic, and your skin and anything you're wearing morphs into burning hot lava. The air around you swelters with heat, and tiny sparks of flame dance behind you as you pass. As a single action, which has the concentrate trait, you can change one of your chosen abilities to a different option from the list.

*   **Enlarging Eruption** You erupt in lava, which clings to you and hardens, causing your body to swell and burst until you grow to size Large. You're clumsy 1. Your reach increases by 5 feet (or by 10 feet if you started out Tiny), and you gain a +2 status bonus to melee damage. You can't choose this option if you're already Large or larger.
