A vaccine grants a creature immunity to a specific strain of _disease_ of a level equal to or less than the vaccine's level, and a +2 item bonus on all saving throws against other strains of the same disease. For example, a vaccine could grant immunity to _filth fever_ inflicted by _otyughs_, but would only grant a +2 saving throw bonus against filth fever inflicted by a _giant rat_.

**Craft Requirements** Creating a vaccine requires a sample of the disease in question.

**Duration** Permanent.
