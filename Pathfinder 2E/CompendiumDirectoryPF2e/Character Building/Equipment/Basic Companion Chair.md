# Basic Companion Chair

### [[barding]][[companion]]


**Price** 4 sp; 
**Bulk** 1; **Size** med
**Usage** other

Light barding around the torso connects via struts to a number of wheels to assist animal companions' movement. Companion chairs can be fitted for animal companions of any shape or size and have two- and four-wheel configurations depending on the level of physical support needed. Like the basic chair, a companion chair is ideal for everyday use but not more strenuous activity, making it more common among non-adventurers.
