# Dragonscaled Kobold

### 






Your scales are especially colorful, possessing some of the same resistance a dragon possesses. You gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1) to the damage type associated with your draconic exemplar. Double this resistance against dragons' Breath Weapons.
