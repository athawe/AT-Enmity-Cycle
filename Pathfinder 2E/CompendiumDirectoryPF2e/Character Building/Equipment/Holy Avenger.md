The gleaming holy avenger is the iconic weapon of powerful paladins. The crossbar of this +2 greater striking [[Equipment/Holy|Holy]] cold iron longsword is styled to look like angel wings. Tradition holds that those who see their reflection in a holy avenger's highly polished blade have their faults laid bare. If you are evil, you are [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] while carrying or wielding this weapon.
