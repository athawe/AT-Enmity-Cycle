# Battledancer
## Feat 1
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** classfeature; 




To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you command your foes' attention with mesmerizing motions.

You are trained in Performance and gain the [[Feats/Fascinating Performance|Fascinating Performance]] skill feat. You gain [[Feat_Feature Effects/Effect_ Panache|Panache]] during an encounter when the result of your Performance check to [[Actions/Perform|Perform]] exceeds the Will DC of an observing foe, even if the foe isn't fascinated.
