# Inner Strength `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[barbarian]][[concentrate]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 




Your strength is part of your rage, so as long as your anger remains, you can gather your strength and rage to overcome any sort of enfeeblement.

You reduce your [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]] condition's value by 1.
