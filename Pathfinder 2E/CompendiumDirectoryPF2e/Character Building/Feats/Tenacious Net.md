Escaping your nets is no simple task. The Athletics DC to Force Open or Escape your nets increases from 16 to 18. After a creature you grabbed with a net Escapes or Forces Open the net, stray strands of the net cling to the creature, causing them to remain [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the beginning of their next turn.
