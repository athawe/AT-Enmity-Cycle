# Silencing Strike `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[barbarian]][[incapacitation]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 




A quick strike to the face or mouth silences your opponent. Make a melee Strike against a foe. The foe must succeed at a Fortitude check save against your class DC.

* * *

**Success** The target is unaffected.

**Failure** The target is dazed and can barely vocalize. It's [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 1]] and its speech is raspy and hard to understand. It must succeed at a DC 11 Flat check to use linguistic actions or supply verbal spellcasting components until the end of its next turn.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned 3]] instead of stunned 1.
