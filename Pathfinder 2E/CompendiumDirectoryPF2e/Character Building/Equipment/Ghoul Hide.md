# Ghoul Hide
## Item 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[invested]][[magical]]

**Category** medium; **Group** leather
**Price** 220 gp; 
**Bulk** 2; **Size** med
**Usage** wornarmor

Stitched together from pieces of ghoul skin, this suit of _+1 hide armor_ grants you a +1 item bonus to saving throws against disease and paralysis and makes you immune to the paralysis of ghouls. _Ghoul hide_ with a _resilient rune_ increases the resilient rune's item bonus to saving throws against disease and paralysis by 1 (maximum +4).

_Ghoul hide_ hisses with sibilant hatred at the touch of elves. When worn by a creature with the elf trait, the armor gains the noisy trait.
