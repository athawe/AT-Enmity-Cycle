# Steady Balance
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Acrobatics
* * *
You can keep your balance easily, even in adverse conditions. Whenever you roll a success using the [[Actions/Balance|Balance]] action, you get a critical success instead. You're not [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] while attempting to Balance on narrow surfaces and uneven ground. Thanks to your incredible balance, you can attempt an Acrobatics check instead of a Reflex save to [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]].
