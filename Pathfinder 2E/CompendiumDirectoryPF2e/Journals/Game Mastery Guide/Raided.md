A horde of raiders attacked your settlement and killed and wounded several of your people. This could have been a band of highway robbers or a conquering army.

You have a relic from those times; add an armor or shield worth 15 gp or less to your background options. If you select this option instead of a skill feat, you are trained in Medicine.
