TOWNSFOLK HOUSING LODGE MUNICIPAL
**District** Little Arm
Once the home of a beloved fortune-teller, this building now serves as a hostel and resource hall for traveling Mwangi. 
**Wares** lodging (floor space or bed—no private rooms), spellcasting services 
**Spellcasting** Primal spells are available for purchase from Jiolan. He typically has the following arcane spells available: **3rd** heal, remove disease; **2nd** animal messenger, continual flame, restoration; **1st** heal (×2), mending; **Cantrips** (3rd) dancing lights, guidance, know direction, prestidigitation, stabilize. Other spells are available if arrangements can be made a day in advance, and if the GM wishes to give these other spells to Jiolan’s familiar. 
[[Jiolan Verneeth]] (N male human witch 5; indifferent; *Perception DC 19, Will DC 21*) After elderly Madam Mvashti passed away and her daughter Koya accompanied Ameiko to Minkai, ownership of this building reverted to the town for a few months. It was then decided that the building would be handed over to the Mwangi, who now use it and a few neighboring buildings as a sort of hostel and waystation for nomadic travelers. If the PCs earn the support of Mvashti’s Place, Jiolan waives their base fees for spellcasting services (but still requires payment for costly components as appropriate for the spell).
