# Field Discovery (Mutagenist)
## Feat 5
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You learn a special discovery depending on your field.

When using [[Class Features/Advanced Alchemy|Advanced Alchemy]] to make mutagens during your daily preparations, you can use a batch of [[Class Features/Infused Reagents|reagents]] to create any three mutagens instead of just two of the same mutagen.
