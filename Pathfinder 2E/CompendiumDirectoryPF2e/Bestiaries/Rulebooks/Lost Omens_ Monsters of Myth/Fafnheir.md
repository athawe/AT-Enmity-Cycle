Unless the creature critically succeeded at the saving throw, each day the doomed value increases by 1.

Fafnheir is the fabled Father of Linnorms. He's larger than all other linnorms on Golarion, with a length of 60 feet and a weight upwards of 10 tons. Fafnheir is a clever and powerful creature, worthy of the fear of all people in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings.
