# Disintegration Bolt
## Item 15
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[consumable]][[magical]]

**Category** ammo; 
**Price** 1300 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. When an activated _disintegration bolt_ hits a target, it is subject to a [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]] spell requiring a DC 34 Fortitude check save. As with the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the target's saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of _disintegrate_.
