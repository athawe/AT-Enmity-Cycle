  - name: "Howl"
    desc: "`pf2:3` (auditory,concentrate,fear,incapacitation,mental,primal) **Frequency** Three times per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The wendigo unleashes a forlorn howl that can be heard up to 1 mile away. Any creature that hears the howl must succeed at a DC 38 Will check save or be [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 1]]. Any creature that critically fails and is within 120 feet of the wendigo is instead [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 3]], and is also fleeing for 1d4 rounds (or until it's no longer frightened, whichever comes first).\n\nA creature frightened by a wendigo's howl still naturally recovers from its fright but can't reduce it below frightened 1 in this way until 1 hour has passed or magic is used. Whether it succeeds or fails its save, a creature is then temporarily immune to that wendigo's Howl for 24 hours."

  - name: "Ride the Wind"
    desc: "`pf2:r` (air,concentrate,primal) **Trigger** The wendigo casts [[Spells/Migration|Migration]] while it has Grabbed a foe.\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The wendigo attempts to turn the grabbed creature into wind and carry it along as part of the action. If the target succeeds at a DC 38 Will check save, it prevents itself from being transformed; in this case, the wendigo still transforms, automatically releasing the victim. A creature forced to Ride the Wind along with the wendigo is exposed to wendigo torment.\n\nThe target can attempt a new Will save each round to return to normal, though it immediately becomes corporeal and begins falling if it succeeds."

  - name: "Wendigo Torment"
    desc: " (curse,mental,primal) A creature affected by wendigo torment can't recover beyond stage 1 until it has been restored to full HP.\n\n**Saving Throw** DC 38 Will check\n\n**Stage 1** [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 4]] (1 day)\n\n**Stage 2** As stage 1 (1 day)\n\n**Stage 3** The creature searches for an individual of its own ancestry to kill and devour. It then becomes affected by wind walk and sprints into the sky so fast that its feet burn away into jagged stumps. As the creature wind walks into the sky, it is replaced by a new wendigo over 2d6 minutes.\n\n[[Spells/Wish|Wish]], similar magic, or a 9th-rank [[Spells/Resurrect|Resurrect]] ritual can return the victim to life. The new wendigo remains even if the victim is resurrected."
