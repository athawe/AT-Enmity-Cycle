    desc: "The target becomes a scrying sensor, allowing you to see through its eyes, smell what it smells, and similarly use its other senses. If you can cast a spell with the revelation trait that affects your senses, such as [[Spells/See the Unseen|See the Unseen]], while this spell is active, you gain the benefit of the spell through the target's senses instead of your own. You can also speak through the target, with a voice much like yours, though it takes on some of the timbre and character of the target's growls or squawks. You can use [[Actions/Command an Animal|Command an Animal]] on the target as part of [[Actions/Sustain|Sustaining this Spell]]. You don't need line of sight or line of effect to your target when you [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast this Spell]]."
