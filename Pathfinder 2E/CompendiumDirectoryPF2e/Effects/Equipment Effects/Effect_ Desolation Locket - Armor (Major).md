# Effect: Desolation Locket - Armor (Major)
## Level 19
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Desolation Locket (Major)|Desolation Locket (Major)]]

The _desolation locket_ numbs you to further despair, and you gain a +4 item bonus to saving throws against emotion effects. When you critically fail a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a failure instead.
