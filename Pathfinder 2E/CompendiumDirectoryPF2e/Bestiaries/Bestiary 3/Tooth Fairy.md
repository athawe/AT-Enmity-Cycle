Lone fairies usually need several minutes of elbow grease and a sleeping or restrained subject to extract a tooth.

* * *

Tooth fairies spawn when a child's tooth (or, less commonly, an entire child) is buried in terrain rife with fey energies. Hatching from the buried teeth like larvae from an egg, tooth fairies build crude pliers from whatever they can find, then go hunting for more teeth-regardless of the owners' willingness.
