# Circuit Judge

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")






You're a circuit judge, a courtroom on horseback who serves a group of communities out in the Mana Wastes or a similar backwoods region. You show up every couple of months, hear the cases that have piled up since your last visit, give verdicts, and then it's on to the next town in your itinerary. It's not the easiest life in the world, but it's an interesting one, and you hear some mighty strange cases. Chances are, it was one of those cases that set you on the road to adventure.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in Deception and Legal Lore. You gain the [[Feats/Lie to Me|Lie To Me]] skill feat.
