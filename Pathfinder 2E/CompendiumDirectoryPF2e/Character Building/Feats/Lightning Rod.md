# Lightning Rod `pf2:3`
## Feat 6
### [[air]][[composite]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[metal]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 




You smash a metal rod into your foe and call lightning to it. Attempt a 1-action melee Elemental Blast using the metal element. On a hit, the target is skewered with a metal rod, which gives it a –1 circumstance penalty to AC and saves against electricity; the penalty is –2 if the creature also has the metal trait, is made of metal, or is wearing metal armor. A hit creature immediately takes 0d12 electricity damage with a DC 10 Reflex check check to pull the lightning rod free.

* * *

**Level (+6)** The electricity damage increases by 1d12.
