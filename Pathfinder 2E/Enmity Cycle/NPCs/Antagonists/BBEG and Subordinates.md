Jonah is the final boss, Zridi and Indrajit work for him. 
They could use the [Tattoo Whispers](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rituals.aspx?ID=51) ritual to communicate at times.
## [[Jonah]] - Wizard
- Plans 
	- Part way through the game, strong people that the party know will start vanishing as Jonah kills them to add them to his army. Periodically over time he has gradually been skimming bodies from travelers that are lost in the desert and framing the deaths to just be due to monsters, gangsters, and Water Lords. 
	- He poses as a barber & hairdresser in town. It gives him ample opportunity to speak with targets privately, enchant them with [[Dominate]] and [[Rewrite Memory]] and more. 
	- Will eventually have to venture to the Cathedral of Claws to perform his lichdom ritual.
	- How does he hide his comings and goings to smuggle in the bodies and out the zombies? Or does he need to? Maybe he leaves out for trips and pretends to go somewhere else for the time, avoiding doing his dirty work within Lamasara's walls at all.

## [[Indrajit]] the Rakshasa 
- Plans 
	- The only one who has sussed out Indrajit's honeyed words is the [[Conspirator Dragon (Adult)]].
	- "A group of famous bounty hunters have come to town, we don't know what their goal is here. We already tried to establish contact but our man was killed when he tried to approach them. Find out what they are planning. If they are here because of us, you have my permission to kill them."

## [[Zridi]] the Pairaka
- Plans 
	- Zridi plans to use the Enmity Cycle to destabilize Thuvia, weakening them for the purpose of causing their eventual decline. This helps Jonah by causing conflict that will move the nation towards unrest, a state where he can work on building his undead army.
