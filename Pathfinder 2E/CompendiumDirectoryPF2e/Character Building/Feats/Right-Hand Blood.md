# Right-Hand Blood
## Feat 5
### [[gnoll]]

**Category** ancestry; 




It's said that the flesh of the right side of a hyena can heal diseases, but that of the left side is poisonous. You can take 1 damage to feed someone blood from your right side and Administer First Aid or take 2d8 damage to Treat Disease or Treat Wounds; in either case, you don't need healer's tools, and gain a +1 item bonus. Blood from your left side causes the check to critically fail automatically.
