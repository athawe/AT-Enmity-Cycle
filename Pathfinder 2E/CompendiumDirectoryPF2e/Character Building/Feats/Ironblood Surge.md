# Ironblood Surge `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ironblood Stance
* * *
**Requirements** You are in [[Feats/Ironblood Stance|Ironblood Stance]]

* * *

You steel yourself, preparing to resist oncoming attacks and using your muscles to absorb the impact.

You gain the benefits of your iron sweep's parry trait (a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn) and your resistance from Ironblood Stance increases to your Strength modifier (if it's higher) for the same duration.
