# Chirurgeon
## Feat 1
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You concentrate on healing others with alchemy. You start with the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical elixirs with the healing trait, in addition to your other formulas.

Your research field adds a number of formulas to your formula book; these are your signature items. When using a batch of [[Class Features/Infused Reagents|Infused Reagents]] to create your signature items using [[Class Features/Advanced Alchemy|Advanced Alchemy]], you create three items instead of two. Each time you gain a level, you can swap one of your signature items with another formula in your formula book. This new signature item must be on your research field's list of possible signature items.

You can use your proficiency rank in Crafting for anything that requires a proficiency rank in Medicine (such as prerequisites), and use your Crafting modifier in place of your Medicine modifier for all Medicine checks.

## [[Class Features/Field Discovery (Chirurgeon)|Field Discovery]]Level 5

When using Advanced Alchemy to make any elixir with the healing trait during your daily preparations, you can create three elixirs with each batch of reagents instead of two.

## [[Class Features/Perpetual Infusions (Chirurgeon)|Perpetual Infusions]]Level 7

You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items. You gain the ability to create two 1st-level alchemical items using [[Class Features/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] without spending a batch of infused reagents. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.

## [[Class Features/Perpetual Potency (Chirurgeon)|Perpetual Potency]]Level 11

Your perpetual infusions improve, allowing you to use Quick Alchemy to create more powerful items with no cost. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.

Moderate [[Equipment/Antidote (Moderate)|Antidote]] and [[Equipment/Antiplague (Moderate)|Antiplague]].

## [[Class Features/Greater Field Discovery (Chirurgeon)|Greater Field Discovery]]Level 13

When you use Quick Alchemy to create any type of elixir of life, the creature drinking the elixir gains the maximum Hit Points possible for that elixir, instead of rolling to determine the number of Hit Points regained.

## [[Class Features/Perpetual Perfection (Chirurgeon)|Perpetual Perfection]]Level 17

You have perfected your perpetual infusions, allowing you to use Quick Alchemy to create even more powerful items at no cost. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.
