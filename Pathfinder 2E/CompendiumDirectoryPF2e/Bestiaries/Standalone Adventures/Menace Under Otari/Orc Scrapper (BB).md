Orcs are proud, strong humanoids that live by the rule that might makes right. They amass in warbands both large and small, conquering territory and robbing those unlucky enough to cross their path. Countless small settlements, outposts, and forts have fallen at the hands of orc raiders, whose sheer destructiveness leaves an indelible mark on the lands they conquer. The furious and undisciplined rankand-file scrappers make up the bulk of an orc warband.
