Each of these factions represent groups with which the PCs can build reputation—but as ever in matters political, earning favor with one faction can earn the hatred of another. 
**The Other Hand**: Deyad's group. All reputation gained here is mirrored with reputation lost from the Lingering Note, and vice versa. In particular, they sponsor and are joined by orators, actors, dancers and the gladiators (loosely). The normally conflicting groups of The Other Hand and The Lingering Note have an even appreciation for music.
**Runewatchers**: The Runewatchers have collected lore and tales about old Thuvia while also ????. The Runewatchers meet on the first day of each season at **Hakren Zost**’s home (area 8) to share rumors and news—gatherings that have mostly become glorified social visits of late. 
**Lamasara's Faithful**: Lamasara’s current religious leader is **Djamila Nacera**. The cathedral to Pharasma is the largest building in town (area 1). The Bank of Abadar employs Sheriff **Bolgrin Hemlock** to command the Lamasaran Guard, and his ever smoking gnomish deputy **Merziver Quickstamp** handles the delicate matters of politics and public relations. The Lamasaran Guard patrols both the settlement’s streets and the roads through its hinterlands, and are responsible for the safety of the citizens. The Lamasaran Guard is based out of the Lamasara garrison. If a party becomes particularly close with the Runewatchers, their reputation with Lamasara's Faithful is limited (and potentially lowered) to Liked. The law respects those of arcane skill, but is always wary of the increased potential for mischief.
**Lamasara Mercantile League**: The oldest faction in town is the Lamasara Mercantile League. Originally consisting of members from the town’s four founding families, the Mercantile League today counts most of Lamasara’s shopkeepers, innkeepers, and providers among their number. The Lamasara Mercantile League bases its operations out of a large building near the town’s waterfront (area 40). 
**Lingering Note**: Kylas' group. Run from his manor in the Riverside Estates. Frequently supports those artists that create works that can endure the test of time. Also has closer ties with the tourists and people from Osirion. Painters, sculptors, architects, writers (fiction, history, poetry), smiths, carpenters and glassblowers are all sponsored by the Lingering Note. They find rare common ground over music. 
**Townsfolk**: Finally, there are the townsfolk themselves, ably represented by **Queen Zamere**. Many artists are here. modest castle

### Earning Reputation
The party earns reputation for these seven factions as a group, not as individual PCs; GMs should keep track of the PCs’ current reputation category and current Reputation Points publicly, so the players always know where they stand with the seven factions. The party’s starting Reputation Points for each faction are listed below, along with any advantages and disadvantages for each tier of reputation (if a tier is not listed, then no advantage or disadvantage is gained at that tier). Reputation Points can be earned or lost as the GM sees fit.

|                |                       |                         |                              |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Reputation** | **Reputation Points** | **Raised By**           | **Lowered By**               |
| **Revered**    | 30 to 50              | Major favor             | Moderate or major disservice |
| **Admired**    | 15 to 29              | Major favor             | Any disservice               |
| **Liked**      | 5 to 14               | Moderate or major favor | Any disservice               |
| **Ignored**    | –4 to 4               | Any favor               | Any disservice               |
| **Disliked**   | –5 to –14             | Any favor               | Moderate or major disservice |
| **Hated**      | –15 to –29            | Any favor               | Major disservice             |
| **Hunted**     | –30 to –50            | Moderate or major favor | Major disservice             |

### The Other Hand
A faction that enthusiastically believes that momentary art is the best kind. 
Starting Reputation Points –4 
**Revered**
If the PCs are at least 9th level, club members are willing to oust Deyad as their leader to install one (or more) of the PCs in his place, leading to a Severe encounter against Deyad and a few of his remaining loyalists; if Deyad is defeated, the PCs take command of the The Other Hand.
**Admired** 
Once a month, if a PC is arrested, the The Other Hand pulls strings to get them out of jail.
**Liked** If the PCs haven’t been invited to join the club, they are at this time. 
**Disliked** 
Members of the The Other Hand sometimes mock the PCs or toss insults their way in public. Businesses affiliated with them become harder to haggle. 
**Hated** 
The insults grow more common and cruel; PCs are targeted more often by robberies or even muggings. Businesses affiliated with them start charging a 15% fee.
**Hunted**
The The Other Hand arranges a hit on the party, sending a group of hired bandits to attack them at some point when they’re on their way out of town or in a vulnerable position; this should be a Severe encounter of the GM’s design. To detect that they're being trailed, the PCs will have to succeed on a secret *DC 30 Perception check* which is checked hourly while in town. If the PCs defeat the bandits, the The Other Hand sends another out to get them once every 1d4 months as long as they remain **Hunted**.

### Runewatchers 
Scholars interested in trading lore about ancient Thuvia, and who keep an eye out for ancient dangers. 
Starting Reputation Points 4 
**Revered** 
The Runewatchers make a donation to the party in the form of an Endless Grimoire (Pathfinder Secrets of Magic 162) with the Sihedron emblazoned on its cover. 
**Admired** 
The Runewatchers are so impressed with the PCs that they decide to share their greatest secrets with them. This unlocks access to the Runescarred archetype (Pathfinder Lost Omens World Guide 119) and the Ritualist archetype (Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide 187) for the PCs. Items purchased from the Runewatchers now have a 15% discount. 
**Liked** 
The Runewatchers invite the PCs to take part in their gatherings, and are also willing to offer some of the magic items from their collection for sale. GMs should build a small list of magic items of 8th-level or lower, curated to be useful for the PCs, for them to consider purchasing. **Hated** 
The Runewatchers spread rumors about the PCs as being potential agents of **Ruby Prince Khemet III**(ruler of Osirion), resulting in a –1 penalty to all Diplomacy checks made in town. 
**Hunted** 
The Runewatchers’ rumor-spreading has gone so far that a group of unscrupulous adventurers takes it upon themselves to track the PCs down and ambush them as they're returning to town. This should be a Severe encounter of the GM’s design against a group of four foes. If the adventurers are defeated, a new group seeks them out once every 1d4 months they remain at this level with the Runewatchers.
### Lamasara's Faithful
Lamasara’s religious community, a collection of cathedrals, temples and shrines of which Pharasma's is the largest. Other notable deities include Sarenrae, Shelyn, and Abadar. 
Starting Reputation Points 12 
**Revered** 
The faithful of Abadar officially deputizes the PCs, granting them the right to issue arrests in Lamasara’s name, and allowing them free use of the Lamasara Garrison’s lodgings, training facilities, and workshops.

**Liked** 
The prices for healing or items at the cathedral decrease to 90% of regular asking price. 
**Disliked** 
The prices for healing or items at the cathedral increase to 110% of regular asking price. 
**Hated**

### Lamasara Mercantile League 
A union once formed by the town’s founding families, but now represented by providers and shopkeepers. 
Starting Reputation Points 0 
**Revered** 
The Mercantile League shares up-to-date hints, advice, and opportunities with the party. The maximum task level for any legal Earn Income opportunity in Lamasara increases by 2. 
**Admired**. 
Word of the PCs’ high standing in the Mercantile League damages their reputation with the LINGERING NOTE; once a month, reduce their faction points with that faction by 1d4. 
**Hated** 
Prices for any service provided by members of the Mercantile League are doubled for the party. 
**Hunted** 
The Mercantile League loathes the PCs so much that their members spend a significant amount of time spreading rumors, pressuring others to cut ties, and otherwise hindering the party’s reputation. Each month, the PCs lose 1d6 Reputation Points, reduced from factions other than the Lamasara Mercantile League as they wish. 
### Lingering Note
Kylas' group. An organization that deeply respects and loves the enduring aspects of certain art forms. Starting Reputation Points –8 
**Revered** 
Kylas Akhom himself invites the PCs to a grand feast at his manor. Feel free to roleplay this event out, but at the end of the feast, he presents each PC with a one-time gift of a permanent magic item of a level equal to that PC’s level. 
**Admired** 
Word of the PCs’ high standing in the Lingering Note damages their reputation with The Other Hand; once a month, reduce their faction points with that faction by 1d4. 
**Disliked** 
Other Hand agents take extra time spreading slanderous rumors about the PCs in town. This causes the PCs to suffer a –1 circumstance penalty on all attempts to Gather Information, unless they’re doing so with a member of a faction that they are at least **Liked** by. Businesses affiliated with them become harder to haggle. 
**Hated** 
As **Disliked**, but a –2 circumstance penalty. Businesses affiliated with them start charging a 15% fee.
**Hunted** 
Kylas hires a group of headed by an assassin to murder the party. This should be built as a Severe encounter; the timing of the attack is left to the GM. If the assassins are defeated, Kylas hires another group every 1d4 months as long as he remains active and free to act. 
### Town Watch 
Lamasara’s town guards are keepers of the peace and protectors of the citizenry. 
Starting Reputation Points 0 
**Revered** 
The Town Watch officially deputizes the PCs, granting them the right to issue arrests in Lamasara’s name, and allowing them free use of the Lamasara Garrison’s lodgings, training facilities, and workshops. 
**Admired** 
The Town Watch makes it clear to all in Lamasara that the PCs are trustworthy. As long as the PCs remain at this tier or better, they do not suffer the **Disliked** or **Hated** effects of the LINGERING NOTE. 
**Hated** 
The Town Watch makes life difficult for the PCs. Attempts to Earn Income, Gather Information, or Subsist in town take a –2 circumstance penalty. **Hunted** 
A warrant for the party’s arrest is issued the next time they set foot in town, but since the PCs are formidable, the Town Watch enjoins the aid of a small group of Hellknights from the Order of the Nail from Magnimar to make the arrest—and if the PCs are captured, they are immediately carted off to Magnimar to face prison sentences. The encounter with the Hellknights should be a Moderate one. If the PCs defeat that, the next one is a Severe one. If the PCs manage to defeat the Severe encounter, the Hellknights refuse to try again, and instead the PCs face periodic Severe encounters with lawful or good groups of adventurers eager to “save Lamasara from their villains.”
### Townsfolk
The citizens of Lamasara, watched over by mayor Kendra Deverin. 
Starting Reputation Points 0 
**Revered** 
The townsfolk commission a statue of the PCs to be erected in the town square, placing their images alongside those of the heroes who defeated Runelord Karzoug. This public display raises their standing in town—the PCs gain 2 Reputation Points with all other factions. 
**Admired** 
The PCs are praised while in town, with citizens giving them small gifts, flirting, or simply admiring them from afar. Once a month, each PC can attempt a DC 18 flat check; on a success, a resident gives them a minor gift of your choosing worth up to 12 gp. 
**Hated** 
The townsfolk hurl insults—or worse—at the PCs whenever they’re in town. The constant deluge of hateful words or thrown garbage wears at the PCs, and while out in public in town they take a –1 circumstance penalty to all Wisdom-based skill checks. 
**Hunted** 
A mob of angry townsfolk rise up against the party the next time they visit town. Treat this as an encounter with a city guard squadron (Pathfinder Bestiary 3 47), but without the Fire Crossbows! action, and change the Lower Halberds! action to Pitchforks and Torches (change the damage type to piercing or fire).
