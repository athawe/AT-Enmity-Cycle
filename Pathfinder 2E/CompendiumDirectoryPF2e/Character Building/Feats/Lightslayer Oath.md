# Lightslayer Oath
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]][[oath]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** tenets of evil
* * *
You've sworn to rid the world of the self - righteousness of celestial beings. Add the following tenet to your code, after the other tenets. "You must banish or slay celestials you encounter as long as you have a reasonable chance of success; in the incredibly unlikely event you find an evil celestial, you don't have to banish or kill it."

When you use your champion's reaction against a celestial, the extra damage you deal with [[Actions/Strike|Strikes]] increases by 1 (or by 2 at 9th level and by 3 at 16th level).
