# Menace Under Otari

### [unique](unique "Unique Rarity Trait")

**Category** pfsboon; 




**Deckhand** You have gained access to the following background for all of your characters (include a copy of this Chronicle Sheet with any character who selects this background).

**Deckhand** \[Background\]

The rolling waves of the high seas, the constant sway of the deck underfoot, and the creaking heights of a ship's rigging are as familiar to you as solid ground. You might have worked on a simple fishing boat, a wealthy merchant's galley, a mighty warship - or even a pirate's caravel. Whether your crew retired, your ship sank, or you've turned to adventuring so you can keep all the treasure for yourself, you still retain an excellent sense of balance and quick reflexes.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Strength and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the Acrobatics skill, and the Sailing Lore skill. You gain the [[Feats/Cat Fall|Cat Fall]] skill feat.
