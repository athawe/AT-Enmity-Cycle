Some people have been framed for crimes they didn't commit, and are being shipped up river to a hidden prison island in the Inner Sea. A group of their friends wants them freed, and the true culprit identified. The true culprit could be a puppet (knowing or unknowing) of Zridi. Ideas and inspiration - *Beyond Horizon -> Of Reefs and Ruin*, a 5th level adventure.
