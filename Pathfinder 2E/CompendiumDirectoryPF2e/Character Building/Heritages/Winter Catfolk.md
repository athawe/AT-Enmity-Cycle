# Winter Catfolk

### 






You have a thick coat of fur that protects you from the cold. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
