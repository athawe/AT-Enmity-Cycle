Among the most dangerous of their kind are the fiery magma worms. In addition to being even larger than benthic worms, the magma worm has a penchant for burrowing through volcanic regions that, over the generations, have infused it with a supernatural link to the Elemental Plane of Fire. The fiery heart of an active volcano is an attractive lair for a magma worm, as are the sprawling fields of molten rock found in the deepest reaches of the Darklands. Legends of ancient dwarven societies and colonists of the Elemental Planes populating moats of lava with magma worms likely have some basis in truth, although the methods used to keep these "moat worms" contained—and prevented from chewing their way through fortress foundations—must have been significant.

Magma worms sometimes frequent areas on the surface where volcanism creates hot springs or other geothermal features, but even then they prefer to spend most of their time burrowing through the ground in their never-ending search for sustenance. Surface lands claimed by magma worms are notable for the mound-shaped burrows these creatures leave behind as they dig.

Cave worms are gigantic scavengers that bore through the depths of the world, eating whatever material they find. Named for their distinctive habitats, these worms are ravenous and display overwhelming destructive capabilities. Cave worms of different types and abilities lurk in the more remote corners of the world—tales speak of arctic worms that dwell within immense glaciers or icebergs and grave worms that burrow through the boneyards of long-forgotten ruins, to name a few.
