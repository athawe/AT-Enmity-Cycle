## Level 1
### 






Granted by: [[Feats/Impassable Wall Stance|Impassable Wall Stance]]

You refuse to let foes past your guard. As long as you are in this stance, when you critically hit with an [[Actions/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]] triggered by a move action, you disrupt that move action.
