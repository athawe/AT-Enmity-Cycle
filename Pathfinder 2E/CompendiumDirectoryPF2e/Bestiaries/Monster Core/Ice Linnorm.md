The ice linnorm dwells amid glacial crevasses, atop wind-blasted mountain peaks, or within glittering caverns carved from the hearts of the mightiest of icebergs.

Immense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inflict as much suffering as possible upon their unfortunate victims. While these serpentine monstrosities might not be the powerful winged dragons most imagine, they nonetheless possess incredible strength and deadly powers that often rival authentic dragon brutality.
