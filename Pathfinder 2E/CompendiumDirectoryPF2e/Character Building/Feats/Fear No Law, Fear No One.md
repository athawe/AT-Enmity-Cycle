# Fear No Law, Fear No One

### 

**Category** bonus; 



**Prerequisites** Order of the Scourge
* * *
When you roll a success on a save against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. In addition, any time you gain the [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened]] condition, reduce the condition's value by 1. As usual, this ability reduces the initial frightened condition by 1, so if you have multiple similar abilities, they don't both take effect.
