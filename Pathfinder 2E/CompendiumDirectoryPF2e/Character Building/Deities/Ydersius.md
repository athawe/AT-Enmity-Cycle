# Ydersius

### 

**Category** deity; 




The serpentfolk god is not dead, but in his decapitated state, he might as well be. Reduced to a feral, animalistic existence, Ydersius is even less aware of his legacy than the lowest of the aapoph. Ydersius's symbol is a snake's skull surrounded by a skeletal ouroboros.

**Edicts** seek to return Ydersius to life, fulfill your passions, conquer your foes with no mercy, achieve glory for serpentkind

**Anathema** put the needs of others above those of serpentfolk, aid the spawn of Azlant
