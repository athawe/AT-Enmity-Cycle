# Unstable Concoction
## Feat 10
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You can create extraordinary-albeit volatile-alchemical wonders, though they have an unfortunate tendency to violently explode when you use them.

When you use [[Feats/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]], you can create an alchemical item from your formula book whose level is up to 2 higher than your advanced alchemy level. You can spend up to 3 additional batches of [[Class Features/Infused Reagents|Infused Reagents]] when creating this item to stabilize it.

Upon activating the item, attempt a DC 10 Flat check; for every additional batch of [[Class Features/Infused Reagents|Infused Reagents]] you spent to create the item, reduce this DC by 2. On a success, the item functions normally. On a failure, the item explodes, dealing force damage to the user equal to twice the item's level (doubled on a critical failure).
