# Scalpel's Point
## Feat 4
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** forensic medicine methodology
* * *
Your stratagems benefit from your precise knowledge of anatomy. When you critically hit with an attack on which you substituted your attack roll due to [[Actions/Devise a Stratagem|Devising a Strategem]], if your attack dealt piercing or slashing damage, you also deal 1d6 bleed to your target.
