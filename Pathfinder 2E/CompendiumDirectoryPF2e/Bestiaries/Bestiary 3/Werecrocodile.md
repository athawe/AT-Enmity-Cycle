The curse of the werecrocodile instills powerful hunger, urges violent displays of dominance, and amplifies greed.

Werecreatures are humanoids who transform into animals and animal-humanoid hybrids under the light of the full moon. The fate of these shapechanging creatures derives from an ancient primal curse that they can, in turn, transmit through their own bites. The stat blocks in this section reflect werecreatures in their hybrid forms.
