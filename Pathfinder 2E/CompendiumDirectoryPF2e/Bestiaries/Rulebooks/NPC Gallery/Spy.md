No empire would be complete without its spies. The spy is a master of infiltrating the court and blending in: they might be one of a number of nobles, a beloved confidante of the queen, or even the court jester. Spies use their skills to subtly manipulate courtiers, turn enemies against one another, and collect valuable information either for blackmail or to auction to the highest bidder.

Though adventurers travel through perilous dungeons and across treacherous wilderness, sometimes the most dangerous place they can end up is in a noble court.
