Many burly aapoph serpentfolk bear minor mutations. Granitescales have bulky frames covered in hard, speckled gray plates. These scales offer additional protection but shed when struck with too much force. As granitescales regrow lost scales quickly, they make effective long-term sentinels and vanguards for guerilla tactics. Granitescales like to carve their shed scales into small chips and attach them as rattles to the ends of their spears. Many an unsuspecting victim has heard the shaking hiss of a granitescale's rattle too late.

Ancient and cunning, the once mighty serpentfolk have suffered numerous setbacks and indignities since the decapitation of their god, Ydersius, millennia ago. Scattered in isolated pockets, the reptilian humanoids constantly scheme their return to glory. Though many serpentfolk labor to restore Ydersius and reclaim power through him, others pursue different avenues to greatness, such as by mastering uncanny magic or practicing spycraft to take down enemy organizations from the inside.
