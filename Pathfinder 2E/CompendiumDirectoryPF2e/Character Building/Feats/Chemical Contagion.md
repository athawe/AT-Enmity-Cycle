# Chemical Contagion `pf2:r`
## Feat 16
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** A creature within 30 feet critically fails its initial saving throw against a poison you created.

* * *

With carefully engineered enzymes, you coax some of your poison to infect another target, using the original victim as a carrier. A creature adjacent to the triggering creature is exposed to the triggering poison.
