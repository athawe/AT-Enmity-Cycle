# Crafter's Appraisal
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting

Your knowledge of items' construction allows you to discern their magical effects as well. You can use Crafting instead of a skill associated with a magic tradition to [[Actions/Identify Magic|Identify Magic]] on magic items, though not on any other sorts of magic.
