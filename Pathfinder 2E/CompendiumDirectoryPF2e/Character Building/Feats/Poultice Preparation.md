# Poultice Preparation
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Herbalist Dedication
* * *
When you create an herbal elixir, you can prepare it as a poultice instead. A poultice gains the oil trait (but remains alchemical, not magical) and loses the elixir and ingested traits. You can apply a poultice by [[Actions/Interact|Interacting]] with one hand.

When you apply a poultice, in addition to the item's normal effects, the recipient can attempt an immediate flat check to recover from a single source of persistent acid, bleed, or fire damage, with the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.
