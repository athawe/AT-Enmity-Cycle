The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."

Death scouts train as spies and assassins for their cult. Other urdefhans scorn their stealthy methods, but none can argue with their results.

* * *

Translucent-skinned scourges of the Darklands, urdefhans are remorseless killers and foot soldiers of the world's end.
