Barristers may serve as criminal prosecutors or as legal advocates, defending the rights of those accused of crimes or named as defendants in civil cases. In a court case or other legal proceeding, the barrister is a 4th-level challenge.

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. In good-aligned societies, these officials carry out their duties fairly. In neutral and evil ones, these officials can be harsh and cruel (with an altered alignment to reflect this), imposing severe punishments on those who can't pay for mercy.
