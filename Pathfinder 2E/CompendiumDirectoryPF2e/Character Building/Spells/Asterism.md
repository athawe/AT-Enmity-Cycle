    desc: "Lines of burning starlight form a constellation around you. Draw five lines, one at a time; each line must anchor at you or a creature or object already connected to a previous line, and it must end at a creature or object within 30 feet of its anchor (possibly allowing the _asterism_ to extend to its full 150-foot range). A creature that begins its turn in one of these lines or enters one of these lines on its turn takes 4d6 fire damage (basic Reflex save). A creature can take this damage only once per turn, even if it moves through several lines. Targets that are part of the _asterism_ do not take damage from it. If the distance between two targets (or you and a target) ever exceeds 30 feet, the line of starlight between the two breaks, and any lines that now no longer have a direct path back to you also break. You can Dismiss the spell.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6."
