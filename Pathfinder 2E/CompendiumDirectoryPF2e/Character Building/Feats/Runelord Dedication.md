# Runelord Dedication
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[class]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** runelord specialization
* * *
Your rune magic increases, and you practice with your school's associated weapon. You gain an additional cantrip of your chosen arcane school, and each time you gain a level (including this level), you add an additional spell from your chosen arcane school to your spellbook, with the same restrictions as the two spells you normally add.

* * *

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Runelord|Runelord]] archetype.
