The wrecker combines a dwarven dorn-dergar with a heavy, gear-reinforced arm cover that allows it to be fired like an oversized sling, then retrieved and reloaded by manually activating a clockwork spool. A wrecker must be loaded to be switched from its ranged configuration to its melee configuration.
