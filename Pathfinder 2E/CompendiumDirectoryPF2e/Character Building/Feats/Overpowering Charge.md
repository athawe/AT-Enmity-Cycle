# Overpowering Charge
## Feat 10
### [[barbarian]][[fighter]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Barreling Charge
* * *
You trample foes as you charge past. When you use Barreling Charge and successfully move through a creature's space, that creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier. On a critical success, the creature takes double damage and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of your next turn.
