These chimeric, desert-dwelling fiends have massive bodies that are part hippopotamus, part large cat, and part crocodile. Though they devour souls for sustenance, ammuts are infamously picky eaters; most will only eat experienced adventurers or, for a special treat, particularly evil creatures, passing over common folk or those whose mettle has never been tested.

Only a few ammuts are known to exist, and most dwell in Osirion. However, recent expeditions into Orv's Vault of the Black Desert have uncovered the existence of ammuts in this region, as well.
