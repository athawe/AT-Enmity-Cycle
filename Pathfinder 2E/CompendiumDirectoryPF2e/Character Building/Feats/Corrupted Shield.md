# Corrupted Shield
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]][[divine]][[void]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** divine ally (shield); tenets of evil
* * *
Your shield ally is more than just a spirit of protection-it's a conduit for deadly divine magic.

When you use your shield ally to [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]] a melee unarmed attack or a melee weapon Strike from an adjacent creature, the attacker takes 1d6 void damage.

If the attack or Strike breaks or destroys your shield, double this additional damage.

The damage the attacker takes increases to 2d6 void at 11th level and 3d6 void at 16th level.
