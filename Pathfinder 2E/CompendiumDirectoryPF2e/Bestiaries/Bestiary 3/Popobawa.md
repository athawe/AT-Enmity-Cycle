Cruel shapechangers, popobawas feed on negative emotions, particularly fear, despair, and anguish. Though they're dangerously strong carnivores that drink the blood of their victims, their greatest pleasure lies in mesmerizing victims to cause suffering and spread chaos. A popobawa moves about populated areas in disguise, seeking new victims and revisiting past victims to bask in their suffering, spreading gossip and incriminating innocents for its crimes while still relishing its own loathsome infamy.
