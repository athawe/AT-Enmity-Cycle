    desc: "You utter a powerful secret at odds with the fundamental nature of the target creatures. Choose a specific resistance or weakness that you believe one or more of the targets have due to [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Recall Knowledge]] or previous experience with the targets, such as resistance to fire or weakness to silver. If the information is incorrect for a given target, the spell has no effect on that target. Affected targets must attempt a Will saving throw.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The creature takes 1 damage of the type of weakness you chose (thus triggering the creature's weakness), or loses its resistance until the end of your next turn if you chose a resistance.\n\n**Failure** As success, and the creature becomes [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 1]] from the revelation of its dread secret.\n\n**Critical Failure** As failure, except the creature is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 3]]."
