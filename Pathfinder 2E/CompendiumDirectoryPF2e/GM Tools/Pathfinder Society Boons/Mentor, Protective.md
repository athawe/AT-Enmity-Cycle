### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Mentor\]\[Social\]**

**Prerequisites** Tier 1 with the Radiant Oath

**Cost** 2 Fame

**Effect** While working with less experienced Pathfinder allies, you shield your more fragile wards from the threat of death. For any PCs benefiting from a Level Bump and whose levels are lower than yours, you increase their current and maximum Hit Points by an additional amount equal to 3 times your Radiant Oath reputation tier.

**Normal** A Level Bump increases a PC's Hit Points by 10% or 10, whichever is higher.

**Special** A PC can only benefit from two mentor boons.
