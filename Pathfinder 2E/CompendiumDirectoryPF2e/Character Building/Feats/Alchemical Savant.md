# Alchemical Savant
## Feat 1
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting
* * *
You can identify alchemical items quickly. When using the Crafting skill to [[Actions/Identify Alchemy|Identify Alchemy]] on an alchemical item you hold, you can do so as a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits, instead of spending 10 minutes.

If you have the formula for the item you are attempting to identify, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check, and if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
