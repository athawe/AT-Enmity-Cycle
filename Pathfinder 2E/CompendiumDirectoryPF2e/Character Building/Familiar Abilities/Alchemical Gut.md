# Alchemical Gut

### 

**Category** familiar; 




Your familiar can act as a bomb coagulant alembic by swallowing the bomb to be affected, which takes two Interact actions from it and one from you. Your familiar regurgitates the concentrated item 1 minute later. If your familiar tries to distill a bomb that's level is higher than your ownâ€”1, it instead takes damage as though it were successfully struck with the bomb.
