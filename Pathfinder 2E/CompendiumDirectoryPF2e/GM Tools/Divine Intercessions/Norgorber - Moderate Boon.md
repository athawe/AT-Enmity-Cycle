# Norgorber - Moderate Boon

### 

**Category** deityboon; 




**Moderate Boon** Your poisons are everlasting.

If your Strike with a poisoned weapon critically fails, or succeeds but fails to deal slashing or piercing damage, the poison is not spent. The poison is still spent once successfully applied to a creature.
