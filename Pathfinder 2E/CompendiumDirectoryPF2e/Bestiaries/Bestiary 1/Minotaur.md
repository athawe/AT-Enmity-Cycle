Roll once and apply the result to all creatures. If the targets are in a maze or similarly difficult-to-navigate structure, the minotaur gains a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. Creatures that become [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened]] as a result also take a -2 circumstance penalty to Survival checks to avoid getting lost for 1 minute. This use of Demoralize doesn't have the visual trait. Each target is temporarily immune for 1 minute.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Hunted Fear|Effect: Hunted Fear]]"

Minotaurs are master hunters that dwell in cunning labyrinths or tangles of underground caverns meant to disorient and demoralize prey. These monstrous tormentors delight in the hunt, in the terror caused by closing in on prey, and in the very moment when the hunted realizes that they have lost the game. Only then will the minotaur charge in for the kill, cutting foes down with powerful strikes or impaling them on its sharp horns.

Minotaurs are known to dwell in mazes, but they can also be found hiding in old ruins and other forgotten corners of the world. In any case, they are solitary creatures, only rarely sharing territory with others of their kind or even more powerful beings that have cowed them into service. Everyone else is little more than prey to be hunted.
