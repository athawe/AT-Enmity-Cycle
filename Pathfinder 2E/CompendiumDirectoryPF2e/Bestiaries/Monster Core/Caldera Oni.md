The caldera oni Strides, then makes a melee Strike. If the Strike hits, the oni can Stride again and Strike again, repeating this until they have either missed with a Strike or made three Strikes total.\n\nThe oni then finishes the dance by calling down volcanic lightning through the cloud of ash. Each creature hit by a Strike during the dance takes 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 electricity damage with a DC 34 Reflex check save."

As hot-blooded as the lava that floods their homes, caldera oni have an incredible appetite for the thrill of war. While they engage in battle to conquer and control others, fire oni also love the thrill of combat, fighting for the sheer joy of it. Presenting a caldera oni with a true challenge can potentially earn their mercy and an offer to serve at their side.

Oni are large, brutal creatures originating in Tian Xia who resemble humanoids with brightly colored skin, tusks, and horns. Though commonly mistaken for fiends, the first oni were originally kami, tutelary nature spirits. These kami suffered a terrible trauma, losing their sacred wards to dramatic disasters or the callousness of others, and as a result transformed into the violent creatures they are today. While some believe that oni can be spiritually placated through proper ritual worship that transforms them back into kami, many of these would-be saviors fall to oni's notorious brute strength, flesh-rending teeth, and command of storms.

Oni possess the ability to disguise themselves as other humanoids. They are rarely creative in their disguises, often choosing a specific appearance similar to their oni form and sticking with it. This simplicity catches many by surprise, however, as people assume oni are limited to a single alternate form, which is by no means the case.
