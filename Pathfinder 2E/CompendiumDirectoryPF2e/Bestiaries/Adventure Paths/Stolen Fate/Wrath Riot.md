The vines cease growing after 10 rounds, and they wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved off before then. The vines can be destroyed if the creature is affected by a good spell or if holy water is applied to the vines (with an Interact action)."

Wrath demons are among the most well-known and feared of the Abyss's fiends, but sometimes a wrath demon becomes stunted in size as the result of too many failed rampages, a punishment inflicted by an angry demonic commander or simple ill fortune. These smaller wrath demons, not much larger than humans, are typically slaughtered quickly by their larger kin, but rarely a group of undersized vrocks can gather in numbers large enough to form a wrath riot.

* * *

Demons are legion. Countless examples crowd the Abyss, many of which have yet to be categorized by mortal scholars. In the Abyss, might very much makes right, and so despite their chaotic nature, weaker demons often gather together to enjoy safety in numbers.

## Throng Abilities

Demon throngs are troops, as defined in Pathfinder Bestiary 3. They have the Troop Defenses, Troop Movement, and Form-Up abilities. They also have the demonic tide ability, which allows them to occupy the same space as other creatures, which is unusual for troops, and Serenity Vulnerabilityâ€”a result of the troop's demonic nature.

## Other Throngs

Wrath riots form because vrocks have an intrinsic quality of cooperation in their dance of ruin, but other types of demons might form into throngs as well. The more notorious forms of demon throngs found in the various tales and historical records include demonic press gangs of babaus, who abduct hapless victims to serve on nightmarish ships, and firestorms of brimoraks, who caper and swoop above eldritch volcanoes.
