  - name: "Repository of Lore"
    desc: "  While the cassisian isn't particularly intelligent, it has perfect memory and can remember everything it sees or hears. This allows it to attempt [[Actions/Recall Knowledge|Lore]] checks on any topic, provided (at the GM's discretion) the cassisian has encountered the topic in question before. The cassisian's limited intellect often prevents it from acting upon its knowledge, making it a better resource than agent in matters of information use."

The weakest of angels, cassisians usually serve as lackey messengers for more powerful angels or as spiritual guides for mortals. Despite their limited intellect, cassisians have a knack for precise recollection, particularly with scripture. Most cassisians are formed from the souls of trustworthy mortals, but some arise from fragments of greater angels destroyed in service to the celestial realms.

The celestial hosts of angels are messengers and warriors, divided into choirs based on their abilities and purviews. The majority of angels are neutral good and live in Nirvana, the plane of virtue and enlightenment. However, some angels, including several angelic deities, have different alignments, and some even dwell on other planes. Regardless of alignment, angels remain benevolent messengers possessed with magical auras to aid their allies.
