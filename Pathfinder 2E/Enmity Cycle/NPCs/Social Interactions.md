Most conversations play best as free-form roleplaying, with maybe one or two checks for social skills involved. Sometimes, though, a tense situation or crucial parley requires a social encounter that uses initiative, much like a combat encounter. As with any other encounter, the stakes of a social encounter need to be high! A failed social encounter could mean a character is imprisoned or put to death, a major rival becomes a political powerhouse, or a key ally is disgraced and ostracized.  
  
Using the structure of an encounter is helpful because it makes the timing clearer than in free-form play, and each character feels like they're contributing. When running a social encounter, establish the stakes up front, so the players know the consequences of success or failure and the circumstances that will cause the encounter to end.

You have much more flexibility in how you run a social encounter than a combat encounter. Extending the length of rounds beyond 6 seconds, allowing more improvisation, and focusing less on special attacks and spells all differentiate a social encounter from a combative one. In most cases, you don't need to worry about characters' movements, nor do you need a map. Be flexible and encouraging as you run a social encounter, and don't worry about nitty-gritty details like character movement except in extreme cases. Allow the PCs to share information about as freely as the players can around the table. If one character is watching the opponent for signs they're lying, assume they can easily convey that to other characters subtly. It's good to remind players of things their characters might know or be likely to notice even if the players, in the moment, don't have them in mind. Describe NPCs' mental states and ask for clarification about the PCs' attitudes when needed.

## GM Core pg 55
When a character uses Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance to influence or impress someone whose level or Will DC you don’t know, **estimate the level of the creature and use that DC**. A commoner is usually level 0 or 1. Don’t worry about being exact. It often makes sense to **adjust** the DC based on the target’s **attitude** for Deception, Diplomacy, or Performance, making the DC easy for a friendly creature, very easy for a helpful one, hard for an unfriendly one, or very hard for a hostile one. You might **adjust the DC further** or differently based on the **PC’s goal**; for instance, the DC to [[Request]] something an indifferent NPC is fundamentally opposed to might be incredibly hard or impossible, and it might be easy to convince an unfriendly creature to do something it already wants to do.

PF2 gives me space to adjust and adjudicate based on context, and I can use some examples and ideas from "Social Encounters along the Silk Road" to do so.

### Mixing in "Social encounters along the Silk Road"
- Based on 2d6 reaction rolls. Mods of -4 to +4 applied by the GM. I'll use the results tables from these for some ideas on stakes and consequences. Values, interests and situational modifiers are all usable (just ignore the math and translate into a circumstance bonus).

#### Animal Handling 
GM sets initial attitude. Typically you [[Make an Impression]] to improve it until you can use Nature to [[Command an Animal]].
- #### Bribery of Judges or Officials
	- Any official, court secretary, vizier, judge, city guard, or other authority could potentially be offered a bribe. The likelihood of this bribe succeeding depends on just how corruptible the official is, what they want if they could be corrupted, and whether what is offered is enough to them.
	- GM might have someone be incorruptible, though whether or not they report the bribe is uncertain.
	- *Relevant values* = Principled -2,  Law-Abiding -2
	- The official is Religious -1
	- The official is Moralist -1
	- The official is Cautious -1
	- The official is Pleasure-seeking +1
	- The official is Self-interested +2
	- The official is Greedy +2
	- Interests 
		- The bribe is in the form of something directly supporting an Ambition or Obsession the official has: +2 
	- Situational Modifiers
		- The bribe is of a value less than 1/5th of the official’s monthly wage or is otherwise of a nature too insufficient to be of great interest: -2 (-4 if the official is Arrogant) 
		- The bribe is of a value greater than the official’s monthly wage: +2 
		- The risk for the official of being caught or punished is high: -2 (-4 if the official is distrustful or cowardly) 
		- The risk of the official being caught or punished is very low: +1 (+0 if the official is distrustful or cowardly) 
	- Reaction Roll, Bribery 
		- Roll Result 
		- 2 or less the bribe attempt fails, AND the official will report it. This will almost certainly lead to the PCs being charged with attempted bribery of an official. If the bribe was for a judge to alter the result of a current court case, the reaction roll to determine the result of that case will have a -6 penalty! 
		- 3–5 the bribe attempt fails, the official will not report it. Further attempts to make a different bribe will incur a cumulative penalty per attempt. If the new bribe is of greater value/interest than the last, then the PC will incur a -1 penalty. PCs will suffer a -2 penalty (per attempt) if the new bribe is of equal or lesser value/ interest than the last. 
		- 6–7 the official says he will accept the bribe only if a greater value or additional favor is offered. If the PC refuses, treat as a result of 3-5 instead. 
		- 8–12 the official accepts the bribe and will do whatever he can reasonably do in his power without serious risk to himself to get the PCs the result they want. For example, altering measures, letting a cart pass without inspection, favoring leniency in a trial, etc. However, if what the PCs want requires a high personal risk to his life or career, then treat this result as a 6-7 result. 
		- 13+ the official accepts the bribe, even if it is to do something that would have a risk to his life or career. For example, helping break someone out of prison, helping them commit a theft, or finding a clearly guilty person not guilty in a trial
- #### Disputation
	- A medieval term for a philosophical or religious debate, although this mechanic can really be used for any kind of debating encounter. 
	- Typical Values 
		- The opponent is arrogant +1 
		- The opponent is disciplined -1 
		- The opponent is indecisive +1 
		- The opponent is religious (in a religious disputation ONLY) -1
	- Disputation, Results 
		- Roll Result 
		- 2 or less The Disputation is resoundingly lost by the PC. The judges or crowd may be infuriated, humiliate the PC, or even attempt to assault him. If there are any consequences to losing, the most severe of them will be applied. 
		- 3–4 The disputation is lost by the PC. No one will be impressed by the poor performance. Even supporters will be disappointed. 
		- 5–6 The disputation is lost by the PC, though most people present who already favored the PC's side will still favor his side.
		- 7–8 The disputation ends in a draw. Anyone who already favored one side of the argument continues to do so, and the undecided are split. If there are important consequences to the result, such that it requires a decision one way or the other, the judgment will be closely split with a 50/50 chance it goes for or against the PC. 
		- 9–10 The disputation is won by the PC. Most of the undecided are convinced by his argument, but those who were already favoring the opposite side will mostly be unconvinced. 
		- 11–12 The disputation is won by the PC. Even those who were biased strongly against his side are forced to at least reluctantly admire the skill shown in the PC's debate. 
		- 13+ The disputation is resoundingly won by the PC. The opponent suffers great humiliation and possibly the anger of the crowd. If there were any consequences to victory, the PC might receive further rewards or benefits for his masterful performance.
- #### Gambling 
	- Gambling, Results 
		- 2 or less The PC loses the entirety of his stake 
		- 3–4 The PC loses two-thirds of his stake 
		- 5–6 The PC loses one-third of his stake 
		- 7 The PC breaks even 
		- 8–9 The PC wins up to one-third of his stake (so long as the opponent(s) have as much at stake) 
		- 10–11 The PC wins up to two-thirds of his stake (as long as the opponent(s) have that much) 
		- 12 The PC wins an amount equal to his stake (as long as the opponent(s) have that much) 
		- 13+ The PC wipes out the table, taking the full amount his opponent(s) had staked
- #### Gossip or Information Gathering 
	- Obtaining Gossip, Results 
		- 2 or less The PC fails in his attempt and may face serious backlash or retribution 
		- 3–4 The PC fails in his attempt 
		- 5–6 The PC doesn't manage to get the information but is given some vague clue as to who or where it might be found; the PC could attempt to pursue this, but it would require further checks. 
		- 7–8 The PC doesn't get the information but gets a specific idea of where or with whom to find it; he may need to make another check with a +2 bonus. 
		- 9–11 The PC gets the information he's looking for. 
		- 12+ The PC gets the information he wants, and if the target has any, he may get some further unexpected piece of valuable information.
- #### Haggling 
	- Haggling, PC Selling Item
		- 1 or less Haggling went badly; the target is very angry 
		- 2–3 Haggling went badly, no sale 
		- 4–5 40% of item value 
		- 6–7 50% of item value 
		- 8 60% of item value 
		- 9 70% of item value 
		- 10 75% of item value 
		- 11 80% of item value 
		- 12+ 85% of item value 
	- Haggling, PC Buying Item
		- 1 or less Haggling went badly; the target is very angry 
		- 2 Haggling went badly; the target won't sell unless the PC pays more than normal! 
		- 3–5 Haggling refused, item can be bought at target's price 
		- 6–7 The target will offer a second item to sell, with a small discount for multiple buying
		- 8–9 Item sold at 10% discount 
		- 10–11 Item sold at 20% discount 
		- 12 Item sold at 30% discount 
		- 13+ Item sold at 50% discount
- #### Impersonation 
	- Impersonation, Results 
	- 2 or less The target is certain that the PC is a fraud and will go out of his way to denounce him. If the situation is appropriate, he will engage in violence against the PC. 
	- 3–5 The target is certain that the PC is a fraud. If the target's personality, duties, or agenda favors it, he will expose the PC or take whatever action against him that fits his character. 
	- 6–7 The target is suspicious but indecisive. He feels something is off about the PC but will not act at this moment. However, further interactions will require a re-roll with a -1 penalty. 
	- 8+ The target is convinced that the PC is whom they claim. Only serious evidence to the contrary would change their minds.
- #### Intimidation 
	- Reaction Roll, Intimidation 
	- 2 or less the intimidation fails, and the target immediately attacks the PC physically unless there's an absolutely inescapable reason not to. 
	- 3–5 the intimidation fails, and the target will be more aggressive/opposed to the PC. He may potentially attack. 
	- 6 the intimidation does not succeed immediately, but the target hesitates, and the PC might be able to attempt to double-down the intimidation, rolling again but with a -2 penalty. 
	- 7 the intimidation does not succeed immediately, but the target is nervous, and the PC might be able to attempt to double-down the intimidation, rolling again but with a +2 bonus 
	- 8–12 the intimidation succeeds in the standard way. The target will either do what the PC wants to the extent that it is in their power to do so (as long as it does not involve a direct risk of death) or else will flee if it is possible and sensible to the situation. 
	- 13+ the intimidation succeeds to the extent that the target will do whatever the PC demands short of something that would amount to absolute certain suicide.
- #### Legal Cases 
	- Reaction Roll, Major Offense
		- 2 or less Guilty, worst possible punishment applied 
		- 3–5 Guilty, second worst possible punishment applied, or worst if none other is applicable 
		- 6–7 Guilty, third worst possible punishment applied, or second worst if none is applicable 
		- 8+ Not Guilty Note: in cases of single-punishment offenses, any result of 7 or less is the maximum punishment. 
	- Reaction Roll, Minor Offense
		- 2 or less Guilty, worst possible punishment applied 
		- 3–5 Guilty, second worst possible punishment applied, or worst if none other is applicable 
		- 5–6 Guilty, third worst possible punishment applied, or second worst if none is applicable 
		- 7+ Not Guilty
- #### Public Speaking 
	- Public Speaking, Results
	- 2 or less The attempt fails miserably, and the local crowd may react with violence or disdain. 
	- 3–4 The attempt fails, and the local crowd will likely react with mockery or indignation. 
	- 5–6 The attempt fails, and the crowd reacts with indifference. 
	- 7–8 The attempt is met with moderate indifference; a few people will agree but not necessarily be willing to do anything about it. The PC could attempt a second speech with some new argument but with a -1 modifier to the check. If recruiting, the PC may recruit some very small number to his cause (i.e., 1-10% of the crowd). 
	- 9–10 The attempt is met with some success. Not everyone is convinced, but a good number will agree and would be willing to act to some degree. If recruiting, the PC will gain a decent number to his cause (i.e., As much as 30-50% of the crowd). 
	- 11–12 The attempt is met with strong success. If recruiting, the PC will gain a good number to his cause (i.e., 50-80% of the crowd). 
	- 13+ The attempt is met with resounding success. Most people will be won over to the PC's side, and many will be willing to take action. If recruiting, the PC will gain a large number to his cause (i.e., 75-95% of the crowd). If the action the PC calls for requires danger, the people he has raised will have a +1 bonus to Morale.
- #### Rumor-Mongering 
	- 2 or less The rumor fails to spread, and the target(s) may be hostile toward the PC, potentially insulting or attacking the PC or reporting the attempt to the authorities or the subject of the rumor. 
	- 3–5 The rumor is met with disinterest or incredulity; it does not spread. However, if people with a connection or loyalty toward the subject of the rumor were among those approached, they might inform the subject of the rumor about the PC. 
	- 6–7 The rumor spreads but only moderately. The GM must judge whether it would sufficiently satisfy the PC's motives in spreading it (depending on how widespread the PC wanted the rumor to be). 
	- 8–11 The rumor spreads effectively, causing a result more or less in line with what could be expected. For example, in the case of a defamatory rumor, it would cause damage to the subject's honor and reputation. In the case of trying to manipulate markets via rumor, it would cause a reaction in the prices of goods, etc. 
	- 12+ The rumor spreads extremely effectively, to a farther extent than the PC could have predicted (and maybe wanted). This might include legal action against the subject, arrest, or other actions taken by local authorities. Not all these actions may be things the PC would necessarily want happening
- #### Seduction 
	- 2 or less The seduction goes horribly wrong. The target is horrified, and unless there's a very good reason (of risk to their life, for example) not to do so, will publicly denounce the PC for the attempt. 
	- 3–4 The seduction goes very badly. Depending on the target's character, there is a chance that the target might publicly or privately denounce the PC's actions to the public or selected people or say nothing. Regardless, the target will feel ill-disposed toward the PC in further interactions. 
	- 5–6 The seduction fails. The target will only denounce it if they have especially good reasons (for example, if their morality or duty demands it), but regardless will want nothing to do with the PC. 
	- 7 The target is interested and curious but not willing to act yet. This reaction is either out of caution, distrust, or fear. However, there is some appeal to the idea as much as the target would wish otherwise. The PC may try again later, but with a -1 penalty. 
	- 8 The target is very interested but is playing a bit "hard to get" for whatever reason. The PC may try again later, but with a +1 bonus. 
	- 9–11 The seduction succeeds. The target enters into a romantic or sexual tryst with the PC within the bounds of the target's personality. 
	- 12+ The seduction succeeds extremely well. The target is either in love or deeply infatuated with the PC and will act with more abandon than normal.
