A Pathfinder's mentor is a bi-resonant wayfinder that has developed sapience. Most Pathfinder's mentors are eager explorers that object to staying in one location for long, urging their bearers toward ancient ruins to explore, relics to study, and discoveries to make. To this end, the wayfinder acts as a guide, making Survival checks on your behalf during your travels. A Pathfinder's mentor also has the following activations.

**Activate** `pf2:1` command, envision

**Effect** The wayfinder casts [[Spells/Know the Way|Know the Way]] on you.
