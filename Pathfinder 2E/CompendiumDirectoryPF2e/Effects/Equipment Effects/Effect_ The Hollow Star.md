# Effect: The Hollow Star
## Level 1
### 






Any creature within the bright light of the _Hollow Star_ gains a +1 item bonus to Occultism checks. Deros in the bright light shed by the _Hollow Star_ suffer distracting but pleasant hallucinations and strange visions, and they become [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] when in this illumination.
