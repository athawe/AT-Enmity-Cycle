# Healing Bomb `pf2:0`
## Feat 4
### [[additive2]][[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per round

**Trigger** You craft an [[Equipment/Elixir of Life (Minor)|Elixir of Life]] using [[Feats/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]], and that elixir is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.

* * *

By adding a special catalyst, you transform a healing elixir into a topical projectile. You grant the elixir the bomb trait.

If you throw an elixir of life bomb at a willing target, you hit even on a failure, though not on a critical failure. If your Strike with this elixir bomb hits a living target, the target regains Hit Points as if it had consumed the elixir. On a critical success, the target also gains the elixir's item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 1 minute.
