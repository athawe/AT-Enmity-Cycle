# Effect: Red-Rib Gill Mask (Greater)
## Level 14
### 






After Activating the mask, you also gain a +3 item bonus to Fortitude saves against inhaled effects; this bonus is increased to +4 against the deadly volcanic gas known around Terwa Lake as Dead Man's Breath, and possibly against other similar volcanic gases at the GM's discretion.
