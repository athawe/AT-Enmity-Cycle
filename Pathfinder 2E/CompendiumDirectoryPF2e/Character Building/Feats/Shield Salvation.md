# Shield Salvation
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Bastion Dedication
* * *
You can save your shield from total destruction, even after a devastating attack. If a shield would be destroyed due to damage taken during your [[Feats/Shield Block|Shield Block]], the shield remains intact at 1 Hit Point instead.

Its construction is weakened until you take the time to repair it, preventing you from using Shield Salvation to save the same shield until your next preparations.
