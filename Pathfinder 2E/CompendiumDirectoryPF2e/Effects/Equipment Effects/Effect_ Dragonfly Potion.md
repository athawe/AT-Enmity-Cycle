# Effect: Dragonfly Potion
## Level 12
### 






You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed. Additionally, you gain low-light vision and a +2 item bonus to visual Perception checks, and you can't be flanked except by creatures higher level than you are (though lower-level creatures can still help their higher-level allies flank). These effects last for 1 minute.
