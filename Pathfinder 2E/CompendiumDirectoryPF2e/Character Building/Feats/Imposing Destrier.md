### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** divine ally (steed); Loyal Warhorse
* * *
Under your care, your mount has realized its innate potential. The mount you gained through the divine ally class feature is now a nimble or savage animal companion. During an encounter, even if you don't use the Command an Animal action, your mount can still use 1 action on your turn to Stride or Strike.
