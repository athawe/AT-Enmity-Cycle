# Gruhastha - Minor Boon

### 






**Minor Boon:** Books fall open to insightful passages, and memories spring to mind when they are most needed. Once, when you fail a check to Recall Knowledge, you critically succeed instead. Gruhastha typically grants this boon for an extremely consequential attempt to Recall Knowledge, particularly when misinformation would have dire consequences.
