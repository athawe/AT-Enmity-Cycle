While norns typically keep to themselves, only consulting their triumvirate or occasionally other fellow norns, they sometimes require servants to further their goals or protect their homes. Nornhounds are massive wolves spun from the old, tattered threads of fate, usually moments of time that norns severed to end a life. These wolves gain a portion of the same power over fate that norns do and serve their norn masters with unflinching loyalty.

## Nornhound Packs

Long-lived or powerful norns sometimes spin multiple nornhounds and keep entire packs as guardians. These packs make quick work of intruders and also gain additional powers when working together. Much like a norn triumvirate, a norn pack can their powers to affect the flow of time in a localized area or even stop time outright.
