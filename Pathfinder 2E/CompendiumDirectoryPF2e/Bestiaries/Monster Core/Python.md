This nonvenomous family of snakes is rarely a threat to anything but small mammals and birds, hunting by coiling around prey and crushing victims with their powerful muscles. Nonetheless, larger pythons can be dangerous due to their strength. Herpetologists sometimes keep pythons as pets.

Snakes come in an array of forms, from jungle-dwelling constrictors that wrap around their prey to venomous vipers with deadly bites. Regardless, all snakes consume their prey whole by unhinging their jaws and using powerful muscles to move the food down their throats and into their stomachs.
