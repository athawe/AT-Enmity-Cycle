    desc: " (divine) Destroying the Spectral Devil releases its pure, evil essence into the world, where it can find a new body and re-form. When the Spectral Devil is destroyed, its essence finds the remains of a dead horse and rebuilds its physical body over the course of 1d10 days. Only completing a [[Spells/Consecrate|Consecrate]] ritual heightened to at least 6th level, which consecrates the site of the Spectral Devil's destruction to a good deity, can prevent the Spectral Devil from returning and haunting the world once more."
