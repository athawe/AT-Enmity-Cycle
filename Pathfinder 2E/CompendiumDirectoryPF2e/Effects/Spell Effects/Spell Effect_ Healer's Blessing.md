# Spell Effect: Healer's Blessing
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Spells/Healer's Blessing|Healer's Blessing]]

When the target regains Hit Points from a healing vitality spell, it regains 2 additional Hit Points. The target regains additional Hit Points from healer's blessing only the first time it regains HP from a given healing spell, so a spell that heals the creature repeatedly over a duration would restore additional Hit Points only once.
