# Eyes That Watch

### 

**Category** deity; 




This strange trio of feline eyes is the Forsaken patron of inferiority, cats, and strangers.

* * *

An owb prophet can transfer the power they gain from a Forsaken patron to those who worship them, effectively serving as a deity. Each owb prophet decides their own follower alignments, edicts, and anathema.
