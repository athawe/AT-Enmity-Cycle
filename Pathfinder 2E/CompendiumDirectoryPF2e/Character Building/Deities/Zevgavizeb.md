# Zevgavizeb

### 

**Category** deity; 




The Beast of Gluttondark's sphere of influence encompasses caverns, reptiles, the strong, and all-consuming hunger. A primordial qlippoth-turned-demon lord, Zevgavizeb seems to care little for his followers, and so he is more often propitiated than worshipped.

**Edicts** expand your clutch's domain, dominate your enemies, demonstrate mastery over your crafts and environment, devour the weak

**Anathema** surrender in combat, express weakness in the face of adversity, show mercy to the weak

**Areas of Concern** caverns, reptiles, and troglodytes
