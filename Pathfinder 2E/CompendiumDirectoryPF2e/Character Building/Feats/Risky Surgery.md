# Risky Surgery
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Medicine
* * *
Your surgery can bring a patient back from the brink of death, but might push them over the edge. When you [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]], you can deal 1d8 slashing damage to your patient just before applying the effects of Treat Wounds.

If you do, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Medicine check to Treat Wounds, and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
