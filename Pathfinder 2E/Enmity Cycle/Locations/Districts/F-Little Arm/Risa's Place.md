**District** Little Arm
A comfortable tavern that caters to Varisians and dreamers—a low-key place to relax and share stories. 
**Wares** standard food and drink, including specialties like huckleberry tarts, “peppers ’n’ pig” (skewers of wild boar and hot peppers), spiced potatoes, and Turandarok Reserve spiced cider (chilled to order on request via a ray of frost) 
[[Lamasara Mercantile League#Lanalee Magravi|Lanalee Magravi]] (NG female human sorcerer 3; indifferent; *Perception DC 16, Will DC 18*) Lanalee is always looking for people to entertain her patrons with colorful, fanciful tales in the vein her mother once shared, and allows a PC to Earn Income here with storytelling and the use of Occultism or Religion checks.
