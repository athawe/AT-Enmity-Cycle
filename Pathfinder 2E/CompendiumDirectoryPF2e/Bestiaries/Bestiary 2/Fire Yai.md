Fire yai take the form of fire giants. Like fire giants, fire yai are shrewd and militaristic and have an incredible appetite for the thrill of war. While they engage in battle to conquer and control others, fire yai also love the thrill of war, fighting for the sheer joy of it. Presenting a fire yai with a true challenge in combat can potentially earn their mercy and an offer to join and serve at their side. Fire yai's third eyes shoot forth burning missiles of fire.
