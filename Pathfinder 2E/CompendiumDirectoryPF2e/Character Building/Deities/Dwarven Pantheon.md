# Dwarven Pantheon

### 

**Category** pantheon; 




The dwarven gods are one large family, with [[Deities/Torag|Torag]] as its patriarch. He is joined by his brothers [[Deities/Magrim|Magrim]] (the Taskmaster) and [[Deities/Angradd|Angradd]] (the Forge Fire), his half-sister [[Deities/Dranngvit|Dranngvit]] (the Debt Minder), and his wife [[Deities/Folgrit|Folgrit]] (the Watchful Mother). His children are [[Deities/Bolka|Bolka]] (the Golden Gift), [[Deities/Grundinnar|Grundinnar]] (the Peacemaker), [[Deities/Kols|Kols]] (the Oath-Keeper), and [[Deities/Trudd|Trudd]] (the Mighty). Torag's evil former student [[Deities/Droskar|Droskar]] (the Dark Smith), though technically part of the dwarven pantheon, is rarely invoked by any save duergars.
