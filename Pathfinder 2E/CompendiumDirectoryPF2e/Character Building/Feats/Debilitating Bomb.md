# Debilitating Bomb `pf2:0`
## Feat 6
### [[additive2]][[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per round

**Trigger** You use [[Class Features/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] to craft an alchemical bomb that is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.

* * *

Your bombs impose additional effects on your enemies. You mix a substance into the bomb that causes one of the following: [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]], [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]], [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], or a -5-foot status penalty to Speeds.

If the attack with that bomb hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer that effect until the start of your next turn. Use your class DC for this saving throw (even if someone else throws the bomb).
