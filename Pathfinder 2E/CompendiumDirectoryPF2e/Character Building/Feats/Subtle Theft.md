# Subtle Theft
## Feat 1
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Thievery
* * *
When you successfully [[Actions/Steal|Steal]] something, observers (creatures other than the creature you stole from) take a –2 circumstance penalty to their Perception DCs to detect your theft. Additionally, if you first [[Actions/Create a Diversion|Create a Diversion]] using Deception, taking a single Palm an Object or Steal action doesn't end your undetected condition.
