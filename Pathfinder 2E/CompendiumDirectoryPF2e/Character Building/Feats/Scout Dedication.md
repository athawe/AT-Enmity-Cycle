You are a highly skilled scout, capable of providing your allies a timely warning of any danger. You gain the [[Feats/Scout's Warning|Scout's Warning]] ranger feat.

When you're using the [[Actions/Scout|Scout]] exploration activity, you grant your allies a +2 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls instead of a +1 circumstance bonus.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Scout|Scout]] archetype.
