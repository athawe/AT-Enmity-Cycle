While Ulizmila is long gone, her animated cauldron remains a dangerous guardian of the hut. The mindless construct lurches to life and attacks anyone who dares to enter, pursuing intruders all the way to the clearing's edge before returning to its place inside the hut. When the cauldron attacks, it "bites" at enemies by snapping at them with its hinged lid while its inner surfaces swiftly heat up to cook anything Small it can "gulp" down.

Granted a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic, animated objects take many forms and serve a variety of uses. A few examples of typical animated objects are listed below. Many of these creatures serve as guardians, surprising unsuspecting adventurers when they suddenly attack. Others serve as idle distractions for the exceptionally rich, simple servants created to handle odd jobs, and the like.
