# Stickytoe Grippli

### 






Your hands and feet exude a film that helps them adhere to surfaces. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude and Reflex DC against attempts to Disarm, Shove, or Trip you. When ascending trees, vines, and other foliage, if you roll a success on the Athletics check to Climb, you get a critical success instead.
