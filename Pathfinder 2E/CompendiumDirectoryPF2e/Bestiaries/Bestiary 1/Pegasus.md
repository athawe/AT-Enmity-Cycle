The pegasus is a winged horse prized for its capacity to serve as an aerial mount. Unfortunately for those who desire a saddle-trained pegasus, pegasi are wild creatures and do not readily accept even well-intentioned riders. Pegasi actively resist being mounted or controlled by evil creatures, attempting to buck an unwanted rider at every opportunity. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet.

Pegasi are highly intelligent beasts and have a strong sense of pride and honor. The best way to entreat a pegasus is by speaking to it with grace and offering gifts appropriate to a creature of such majesty. Prospective riders who seek the mount for a worthy cause or virtuous quest have a much easier time coaxing a pegasus into granting its favor. Regardless, a pegasus never accepts a bit or saddle, for reasons both practical and purely egotistical.

In the wild, pegasi live in small herds and establish territories on remote mountains where they are relatively safe from hunters and slavers. They mature at the same rate as horses and can even breed with other equines, though the outcome of such unions is typically a foal with the traits of its least magical parent. On rare occasions, the interbreeding of a pegasus and a unicorn may result in a winged unicorn with characteristics of both parents and an unrivaled sense of righteousness.

Some pegasi carry in them the blood of a mighty and heroic ancestor. These champions of pegasus-kind dedicate their long lives to the pursuit of justice. They possess powerful supernatural abilities to aid them in this fight, such as resistance to fire and poison, immunity to petrification, and holy hoof attacks.
