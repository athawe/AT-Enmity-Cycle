Shadow worms are monstrous cave worms that dwell on the Shadow Plane. Larger and more cunning than most cave worms, shadow worms are fearsome predators that leave swaths of devastation in their wake. Most have glossy, black-armored hide, but those that burrow near velstrac lands are streaked with dark red, for the blood the velstracs spill has soaked into the very stones these shadow worms consume.
