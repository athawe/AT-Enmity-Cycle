    desc: " (divine) When a skeletal Tiger Lord is destroyed, its bones clatter to the ground in a tangle and its armor and weapons crumble to dust. It automatically reforms with its armor and weapons intact (regaining a full quiver of 20 arrows) 1 hour later at 1 Hit Point, allowing its fast healing to resume healing it thereafter. If the trap in area D5 is disabled, the skeleton loses this ability; otherwise, the only way to permanently destroy a skeletal Tiger Lord is to reduce it to 0 Hit Points with vitality damage or evil damage."

Variant skeleton

Made from bones held together by foul necromancy, skeletons are among the most common types of undead, found haunting old dungeons and forgotten cemeteries.
