# Stance: Disruptive Stance
## Level 1
### 






Granted by: [[Feats/Disruptive Stance|Disruptive Stance]]

The slightest distraction can provoke your wrath, and you're prepared to foil enemies' actions.

As long as you are in this stance, you can use [[Actions/Reactive Strike|Reactive Strike]] when a creature within your reach uses a concentrate action, in addition to manipulate and move actions.

Furthermore, you disrupt a triggering concentrate or manipulate action if your Strike hits (not only if it's a critical hit).
