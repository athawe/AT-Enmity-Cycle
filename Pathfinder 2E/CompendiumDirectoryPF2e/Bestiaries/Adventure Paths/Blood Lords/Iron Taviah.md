Unlike a normal Grapple, Taviah doesn't need to be within reach and can move as she pleases, and a successful attempt lasts until the creature Escapes (DC 24), causing the cage to crumble into rust. Any creature can attempt to destroy the cage by attacking it; the cage has an AC of 19, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points."
