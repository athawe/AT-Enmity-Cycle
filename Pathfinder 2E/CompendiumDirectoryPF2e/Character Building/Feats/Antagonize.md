# Antagonize
## Feat 2
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 




Your taunts and threats earn your foes ire. When you successfully [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] a creature, its [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened]] condition can't decrease to less than 1 at the end of its turn until it either uses a hostile action against you or can no longer observe or sense you for at least 1 round.
