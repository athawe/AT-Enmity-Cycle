An etheric essence disruptor emits bursts of discordant ethereal energy through a process based upon Stasian etheric-spirit singers, though without the need for a Stasian coil. Etheric essence disruptors attempt to break down the workings of a spell that manipulates spiritual essence. Upon activation, attempt to counteract an active divine or occult spell within the listed range, with the listed counteract modifier and counteract rank.

The range is 40 feet, the counteract modifier is +13 d20 + 13, and the counteract rank is 4.
