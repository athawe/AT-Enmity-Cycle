# Deimatic Display `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Intimidation
* * *
Imitating animal threat displays, you make yourself appear larger and more imposing. Roll one Intimidation check to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] and compare the result to the Will DC of each animal, fungus, and plant creature in a 15-foot cone. When you do, Demoralize gains the visual trait. You don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language.
