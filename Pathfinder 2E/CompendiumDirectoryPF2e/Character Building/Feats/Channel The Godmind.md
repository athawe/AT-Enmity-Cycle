**Frequency** once per day

You tap into the Godmind's collective cognitive well, rapidly parsing near-infinite variables to read your surroundings. For 1 minute, you gain precise motion sense out to 60 feet, you can see invisible creatures and objects, and you gain the effects of a 9th-rank [[Spells/Truesight|Truesight]].
