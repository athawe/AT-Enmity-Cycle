    desc: "Your litany rails against the sin of wrath, punishing the target for attacking creatures that aren't unholy. The target must attempt a Will save. A particularly wrathful creature, such as a wrath demon, uses the outcome one degree of success worse than the result of its saving throw. The target then becomes temporarily immune to all of your litanies for 1 minute.\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Success** The first time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one creature that isn't unholy, the target takes 3d6 spirit damage.\n\n**Failure** Each time the target uses an action that deals damage to at least one creature that isn't unholy, the target takes 3d6 spirit damage.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]]. Each time it uses an action that deals damage to at least one creature that isn't unholy, the target takes 3d6 spirit damage.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6."
