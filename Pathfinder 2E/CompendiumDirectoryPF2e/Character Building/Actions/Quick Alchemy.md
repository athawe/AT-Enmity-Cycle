# Quick Alchemy `pf2:1`

### [[alchemist]][[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Cost** 1 batch of infused reagents

**Requirements** You have the formula for the alchemical item you're creating, and you're either holding or wearing the [[Equipment/Alchemist's Toolkit|Alchemist's Toolkit]].

* * *

You swiftly mix up a short-lived alchemical item to use at a moment's notice. You create a single alchemical consumable item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn.
