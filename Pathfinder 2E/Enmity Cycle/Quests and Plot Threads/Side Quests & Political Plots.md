Brett Johnson says that the 3 things that must be inherent in a criminal for them to engage in crime are *willingness, ego, and knowledge*.

### Personal PC Plothooks
- Daniel - Thorn Dustwalker
	- Assuming he sticks with a grave robbing ranger - Thorn would likely be affiliated with the Lingering Note. Something could happen that clues him in on the idea that something is going on with the organization though.
	- His fear of ghosts could make the haunts in town tough for him to manage.
	- At level 11 his Favored Terrain feat upgrades to grant him the following: *You need to eat and drink only one-tenth as much as usual, you arenâ€™t affected by severe or extreme heat, and you can walk along sand at full Speed without needing to Balance.* It would be neat if he could gain these effects gradually over the course of the adventure.
- Connor - Duncan Butters
	- Wants chances to improve his cooking, develop on raising undead, and to cook forever.
	- Delicious in Dungeon ideas?
- Alex - Ashfall 
	- Wants to find legendary spell books and lost spells 
	- Likely the most popular with the Pathfinder Society. Would have some foreign connections through which he learned his magic. 
	- Maybe whoever he learned magic from comes by during the lead up to the festival.
- Corey - Jynx Dunewind
	- Made an enemy of [[Djamila Nacera]], head of the Shelyn faith. 
	- 

### The Other Hand & The Lingering Note
- Yin and Yang morally grey organizations run by **Kylas and Deyad**. They are back by or influenced by the [[BBEG and Subordinates]] from the shadows. It's all smoke and mirrors. Kylas died years ago, and Indrajit has taken his place. Deyad has been charmed multiple times by [[Zridi]].
	- Within each organization there is the public face and the quiet dark elements are known only to those with clearance.
- Queen Zamere is away negotiating in Aspenthar, and many of the stronger warriors around town (militia based force?) have been hired by merchants and tourists as guides and escorts (and are thus out of the picture). The time for crime is prime in Lamasara.

## Other ideas 
- Working with the [[Runewatchers]] and [[Hakren Zost]] could tap into Golarion's energies to awaken a [ley line](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1531) running through the region. 
- Perhaps Hakren could teach the party the [Tap a Ley Line](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?General=true&ID=7) Action if they accept the job of helping him with locating and activating a few of them. Perhaps they discover one or more ley line nodes. Maybe he needs protection while they investigate various areas to find it, etc. Or he teaches someone Ley Line Lore over the course of a week so that they can check for them on their own. 
- [Establish Nexus](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rituals.aspx?ID=66)ritual to turn a node into a nexus for easier use 
- [Empower Ley Line](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rituals.aspx?ID=65) to enhance the positives and negatives of tapping a ley line.

- A [Pathfinder's Coin](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=523) left somewhere with an interesting stored message.
