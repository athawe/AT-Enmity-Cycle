    desc: "You call forth a line of bushes native to the region to spring from the ground. The wall of shrubs stands in a line 60 feet long, is less than 5 feet tall, and is a foot thick, providing lesser cover.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (3rd)** The shrubs are now 10 feet tall and 5 feet thick and provide standard cover. The duration of the spell increases to 10 minutes.\n\n**Heightened (5th)** Instead of a line, the shrubs can be made in a ring with a diameter of up to 30 feet that's 10 feet tall and 5 feet thick. The shrubs provide greater cover. The duration of the spell increases to 1 hour."
