  - name: "Corpse Throwing"
    desc: "  A zombie minihulk can throw corpses at foes. While any Medium dead body will do, they sometimes throw zombie shamblers, who take just as much damage from being thrown as the target they hit. A thrown shambler lands prone, but if it's not destroyed, it can rise and use other actions normally."

  - name: "Wide Swing"
    desc: "`pf2:1`  The zombie minihulk makes a hunk of meat melee Strike and compares the attack roll result to the AC of up to two foes, each of whom must be within the Strike's reach. This attack counts as two attacks for the zombie minihulk's multiple attack penalty."
