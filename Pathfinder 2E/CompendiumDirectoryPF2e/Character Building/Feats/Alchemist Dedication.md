# Alchemist Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]][[multiclass]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Intelligence +2
* * *
You put your alchemical interest into practice. You become trained in alchemical bombs and Crafting; if you were already trained in Crafting, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in alchemist class DC. You gain the alchemist's [[Class Features/Infused Reagents|Infused Reagents]] class feature, gaining a number of reagents each day equal to your level. You also gain the [[Feats/Alchemical Crafting|Alchemical Crafting]] feat and four additional formulas for 1st-level alchemical items, as well as the ability to create free items during your daily preparations. Your advanced alchemy level is 1 and doesn't increase on its own.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Alchemist|Alchemist]] archetype.
