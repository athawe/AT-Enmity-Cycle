# Tongue Tether
## Feat 9
### [[grippli]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** snaptongue grippli
* * *
Your tongue can momentarily latch on as readily as your hands. So long as you can freely open your mouth, you do not need free hands in order to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Actions/Grab an Edge|Grab an Edge]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]].

If you have the [[Feats/Long Tongue|Long Tongue]] feat, you can Disarm, Grab an Edge, and Trip with your tongue at a distance that is 5 feet beyond your normal reach.
