This animated object's level can be no higher than the dybbuk's level -2.\n\nThis possession ends when the object is destroyed or the dybbuk leaves it by using this ability again. At this point, the dybbuk reappears in the object's square and can't Inhabit an Object again for 1d4 rounds. If the object is destroyed, the dybbuk takes 5d6 force damage."

  - name: "Malevolent Possession"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (incapacitation,mental,occult,possession) The dybbuk attempts to possess an adjacent corporeal creature.\n\nThis has the same effect as the [[Spells/Possession|Possession]] spell (DC 34 Will check) with an unlimited duration, except since the dybbuk doesn't have a physical body, they aren't [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], and aren't [[Conditions/Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] when the effect ends, though they take 5d6 force damage if the body is knocked unconscious or killed.\n\nIf the dybbuk took control of the target with Malevolent Possession, when the dybbuk departs, the target has only incoherent memories of the interval it was possessed. If a creature dies while possessed by the dybbuk and its corpse remains intact, the dybbuk can immediately inhabit the corpse (see Inhabit Object) as a reaction, in which case the corpse becomes an animated object."

The discorporated spirits called dybbuks arise from souls denied respite in the afterlife, often because they committed some great transgression in life. A priest can appease dybbuks by helping them achieve some esoteric mission, though these tricksters are prone to deceiving anyone who offers them aid. Only by trapping, cowing, or destroying such spirits can a mortal hope to drive them back. Dybbuks hide within household objects or possessed victims. They particularly enjoy taking over the body of someone their target loves and then slowly destroying the lives of both.
