Assassins commit murder, either for pay or due to their belief in a cause, such as a religion or a political movement. Some assassins work alone and choose their own victims. Others are members of assassins' guilds, organizations that accept contracts to kill in return for money, favors, or both.

Some criminals are the desperate who have no option but to break the law to survive, while others choose a life of crime for thrills, forming gangs or underworld guilds that specialize in certain illegal ventures.
