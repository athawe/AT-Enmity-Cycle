Ledgers and marks, positive and negative flows, and levies and allotments are a tax collector's daily bread. Where coin is gained, from whom it is collected, and to whom is it disbursed are their main concerns; the collector is unconcerned with whether the taxed can afford it or take a loan to make up for any shortfall. However, tax collectors aren't immune to corruption: arrangements can be made, deals discussed, documents altered, or coin misappropriated. When dealing with matters of taxes and finance, the tax collector is a 3rd-level challenge.

Magistrates are the cogs and gears that keep bureaucracy running, moving the machine along under the inertia of the status quo.
