A nosoi resembles a whippoorwill, sparrow, or other small bird wearing a heavy leather plague doctor's mask. They are the clerks, messengers, and scribes of the Boneyard, witnessing judgments, directing souls, and generally performing the administrative grunt work that keeps the Boneyard functioning. Most nosois are particularly chatty and eager to discuss how important they consider their individual assignments to be.

Psychopomps are guardians and shepherds of the dead native to the Boneyard, the vast plane of graves where mortal souls are judged and sent on to their eternal rewards or damnations. Psychopomps ensure that the dead come to terms with their transition from mortality and are properly sorted into the appropriate afterlife. They also protect souls from being preyed upon by supernatural predators. Nearly all psychopomps wear masks, especially when they're likely to be interacting with mortals, although the types of masks they wear are as varied as the psychopomps themselves. The courts of the Boneyard preside in Requian, a somber yet melodic language spoken slowly with various tonal shifts.
