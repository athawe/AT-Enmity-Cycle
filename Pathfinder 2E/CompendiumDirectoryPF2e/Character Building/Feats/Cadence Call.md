# Cadence Call `pf2:1`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[auditory]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Marshal Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per minute

* * *

You call out a quick cadence, guiding your allies into a more efficient rhythm.

Each willing ally within your marshal's aura is [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] until the end of their next turn, and they can use the extra action only to Stride.

At the end of each ally's turn, if they used the extra action, they then become [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] until the end of their following turn.
