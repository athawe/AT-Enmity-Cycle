Scions of death by poisoning, piscodaemons are cruel even by daemonic standards, delighting in slow and painful suffering. To a piscodaemon, death is but the icing on a putrescent cake-its true pleasure comes from watching, hearing, smelling, and even tasting raw anguish. While poisons and venoms are piscodaemons' preferred tools, their cruel claws are more than capable of tearing enemies asunder if necessary.

Piscodaemons dwell in fetid swamps and noxious waterways, including the River Styx, the Bile Sluice, and the Drowning Court of Charon, Horseman of Death. They are often accompanied by cadres of hydrodaemons-representations of death by drowning. While they are cunning commanders, piscodaemons are apt to forget their station in the heat of battle and slice their way to the center of the fray.
