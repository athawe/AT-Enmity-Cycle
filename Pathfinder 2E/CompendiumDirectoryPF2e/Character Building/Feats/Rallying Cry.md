You call out to your allies and push them to give their all in combat. All allies within 30 feet that can hear you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level. In addition, these allies become [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] for 1 minute but can only use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.
