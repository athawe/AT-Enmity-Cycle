# Spell Effect: Thundering Dominance
## Level 2
### 






You shroud the target in a powerful predatory aura and amplify its vocalizations. It gains a +1 status bonus to Intimidation checks. Once during this spell's duration, it can take the Thundering Roar action.

* * *

**Heightened (+2)** The status bonus to Intimidation checks increases by 1 (to a maximum of a +4 status bonus for an 8th-rank spell), and the damage from the roar increases by 2d8.
