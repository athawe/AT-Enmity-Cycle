    desc: "You examine the time stream in a particular area, then proceed to stick a few metaphorical pins into it, thickening and slowing down the flow of time until it rumbles along like a river of molasses. Any creature that begins its turn in the area must attempt a Will save.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] this turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 2]] this turn."
