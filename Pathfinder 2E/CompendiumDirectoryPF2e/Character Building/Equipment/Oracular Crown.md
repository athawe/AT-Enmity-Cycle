Patterns themed to your curse cover your _oracular crown_. As your curse worsens, the appearance of the crown changes, introducing extreme angles, stronger colors, or other indications of the intensity of your curse. Similarly, it gets closer to its natural form when you reduce the effects of your curse. You gain a +2 item bonus to Religion checks.

**Activate** `pf2:0` envision

**Frequency** once per day

* * *

**Effect** You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can use only to cast an oracle revelation spell. If not used by the end of your turn, this Focus Point is lost.

* * *

**Activate** `pf2:1` command (healing, necromancy, vitality)

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** Your oracular curse is at its minor stage or higher

* * *

**Effect** You regain 3d8 Hit Points. This amount increases to 5d8 if your curse is at its moderate stage or 7d8 if it's at its major stage. If you have void healing, this activation has the void trait and not the healing and vitality traits.

**Craft Requirements** You are an oracle.
