# Effect: Storm Chair
## Level 14
### 






For 1 minute, you gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed, and adjacent creatures that hit you with a melee attack, as well as creatures that touch or hit you with an unarmed attack, take 2d6 electricity damage each time. As normal, this applies to creatures who choose to touch you, not when you touch or attack another creature.
