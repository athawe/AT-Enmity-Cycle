Barbazus, known also as bearded devils or infantry devils, are murderous fiends who satiate their lust for annihilation by serving as the foot soldiers of Hell's armies, often leading hordes of lesser devils such as imps and lemures into battle. Bearded devils wield serrated glaives to inflict jagged gashes that resist healing magic, resulting in tremendous blood loss. When enemies come too close, bearded devils strike with the spines of their wriggling beards to deliver a wretched contagion called Avernal fever, savoring the sight of their victim's strength being slowly devoured from within.

Barbazus can be found savagely indulging the whims of evil infernal lords from all layers of Hell, rejoicing as they disseminate murder, misery, and anguish as they see fit.

* * *

Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly lemures and imps perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as contract devils and erinyes, while the greatest pit fiends command entire infernal armies.
