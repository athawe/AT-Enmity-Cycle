- Fun social scenes 
	- Salmus, a human tiefling Bard, is trying to woe Francesca, one of the gladiators (dommy mommy). Two things are working against Ricardo though: Francesca already has a secret fiancé and Ricardo isn't as good of a bard as he thinks.
	- A Tiefling merchant selling potions for 20% cheaper than market price out of a rickety travelling wagon. When asked about the origin of the potions, only vague answers are given. They were stolen from a shipment to Pillbug's Pantry. After a few days, he vanishes without a trace, as The Other Hand deals with business.
	- Some young men and halfling have stolen a large keg of what they think is ale. They are pushing it laboriously up a steep hill, joking and grunting from the effort. A few minutes later a frantic alchemist can be seen running around asking if anyone has seen a barrel of Alchemists Fire that has disappeared.
	- Two lovebirds with disapproving parents meet in secret. One from Deyad's group, the other from Kylas'.

Someone with a tressym.

### Bhaltair McClellan 
is an NPC from _Paradiso Countdown_, an introductory adventure for the _[Infinity](http://www.modiphius.com/infinity.html)_ roleplaying game that you can currently snag if you’re a backer of the game’s [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiphius/corvus-bellis-infinity-roleplaying-game).

**Appearance:** A boisterous, round-bellied man with thick red hair that tumbles down into a beard that threatens (but does not quite succumb to) unruly excess.

**Quote:** “You should take a load off, mate. And have a drink. It won’t bring him back, but it’ll keep us all sane.”

**Roleplaying:**

- A loud and hearty laugh that comes easily.
- Somehow finds a way to use elaborate metaphors featuring Ariadnan ales regardless of the actual topic of conversation.
- Likes to slap people on the back. (If it stings, you know he likes you. If it is hard enough to make you lose your balance, you know he does not.)

**Background:** Bhaltair is Ariadnan of Caledonian stock. When he was just a young kid, his father went off to fight in a bloody frontier conflict between Caledonia and Rodina. He never came back. Bhaltair made a pledge that he would work to never see his homeworld torn apart by such senseless violence again. He became a politician and quickly discovered how difficult the dream of peace can be. When the Human Sphere returned to Ariadna, he was at first overjoyed at how it unified the planet…and then watched in horror as the Commercial Conflicts ripped his planet apart again. He lost himself in drink for a time and then, concluding that the only way to bring true peace to Ariadna was to solve the off-planet problems that were manifesting themselves there, he became a diplomat. He did not participate in the negotiation of the Tohaa Contact Treaty, but he has recently arrived to take part in the Alliance Summit.

**Key Info:**

- Although he is a fresh arrival on the EveningStar, Bhaltair had worked with Alinari a few years back when they were both stationed on Shentang together.
- Alinari roped him into working with a Tohaa named Sareelia Mogaal. They all work on the Technology Exchange Commission together and Alinari wanted to open up an “alternative channel of negotiation”.
- Alinari has been having an affair with Gudrun Vastag.

**EXAMPLE: SYR ARION  
**

### Syr Arion 
appears in _[City Supplement 1: Dweredell](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/27955/City-Supplement-1-Dweredell?affiliate_id=81207)_.

**Appearance:** Arion is still a man in the flush of youth: Short-cropped, jet black hair sets off his piercing blue eyes. His frame is only lightly muscled, but toned and trained. The weight of his office, however, has brought bags beneath his eyes. And the late hours his sense of responsibility brings often causes his shoulders to stoop with exhaustion. But when the Syr gathers his strength, the image of a great man remains.

**Quote:** “Just give me time to think. There must be a way.”

**Roleplaying**:

- A passionate man, but — increasingly — a weary one.
- In desperate need of friends, but years of experience and loss have taught him not to trust lightly.
- Rests his chin heavily into the palm of his hand.

**Background:** Arion’s mother died in childbirth, and he was reared as the last child of the Erradons by his father, a man whose faculties were already deserting him when Arion was born. Arion’s father believed that his brother had been killed by the Guild, and the one edict he never wavered from was that Arion should be strictly sequestered. As a result, the only true friend Arion had while growing up was Celadon, the Captain of the Prince’s Guard – a man thirty years his senior.

Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Arion dedicated himself to rigorous self-perfection: When he was not learning swordplay from Celadon, he was spending hours pouring over the musty tomes of his father’s library. He saw that his father was a poor ruler, and believed it was his place to restore the honor of the Erradons by restoring the glory of [Dweredell](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/27955/City-Supplement-1-Dweredell?affiliate_id=81207)**.**

# Antagonists 
Jonah is the final boss, Zridi and Indrajit work for him. 
## Jonah - Wizard
- Goals - He wants to make Thuvia the next Geb, with him as its leader. Maybe his base is inside of some ruins in Osirion. He could be funding or manipulating her.
- Plans 
	- Part way through the game, strong people that the party know will start vanishing as Jonah kills them to add them to his army.
	- He poses as a barber & hairdresser in town. It gives him ample opportunity to speak with targets privately, enchant them with [[Dominate]] and [[Rewrite Memory]] and more.

- Resources 
	- His magic - he specializes in necromantic and enchantment spells. 
## Indrajit the Rakshasa

	- .
	- A group of famous bounty hunters have come to town, we don't know what their goal is here. We already tried to establish contact but our man was killed when he tried to approach them. Find out what they are planning. If they are here because of us, you have the permission to kill them.
- Resources - two sons, Narantaka & Devantaka (destroyer of men, destroyer of gods)

1. Mutual Benefit: The rakshasa and the lich could have a mutual agreement, where the rakshasa provides the lich with valuable information or resources in exchange for protection, wealth, or influence.
    
8. Personal Gain: The rakshasa may see an opportunity to gain status or power by serving a powerful lich, possibly even plotting to overthrow or replace the lich when the time is right.
    
9. Duty: In some cases, the rakshasa might be bound by a curse, magical contract, or other obligation to serve the lich, regardless of their personal feelings towards their master.
## Zridi the Pairaka
- Goals
- Plans 
	- Zridi plans to use the Enmity Cycle to destabilize Thuvia, weakening them for the purpose of causing their eventual decline. This helps Jonah by causing conflict that will move the nation towards unrest, a state where he can work on building his undead army.
