It can't be healed or [[Actions/Repair|Repaired]] and is destroyed at 0 Hit Points, though it naturally recovers a number of Hit Points equal to its level Ã— its Constitution modifier (54 for most roiling incants) each day.\n\nEach time a roiling incant casts one of its non-cantrip spells, it drains its own magic to do so, taking 5 force damage."

Though many spellcasters can harness the forces of magic in a consistent manner, such power can't always be controlled, especially in the hands of reckless researchers, megalomaniacal villains, or untested novices. When magical accidents result in large-scale property damage and the loss of life, these forces sometimes take on lives of their own, forming a dangerous amalgamation of ongoing magical energy known as a roiling incant.

A roiling incant's appearance depends on the type of magic it sprang forth from, though it always carries with it an echo of the destruction it has caused. A fiery evocation roiling incant might look like a storm of burning ashes echoing with the sounds of crackling timber, while a necromancy roiling incant could be mistaken for ghostly tendrils puppeteering shambling corpses. No matter what it looks like, a roiling incant roams mindlessly, attacking everything it encounters, heedless of further carnage it causes.
