# Challenging Relationships
Roll on [[Rollable Tables/Challenging Relationship|this table]] to generate a challenging connection.

## Accidental Fall

This character once inadvertently shoved you off a ledge or balcony. You're mostly certain it was a mistake, but the fall was terrifying, and you've resolved to never be caught unaware like that again.

Add the [[Feats/Cat Fall|Cat Fall]] skill feat to your background options.

Add the [[Feats/Group Impression|Group Impression]] skill feat to your background options.

Add the [[Feats/Hefty Hauler|Hefty Hauler]] skill feat to your background options.
