# Effect: Sense-Dulling Hood (Greater)
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Sense-Dulling Hood (Greater)|Sense-Dulling Hood (Greater)]]

The mask grants you a +4 item bonus to saving throws against auditory, olfactory, and visual effects. Since it dulls your senses without depriving you of them, the mask also imposes a â€“1 penalty to rolls and checks using Perception.
