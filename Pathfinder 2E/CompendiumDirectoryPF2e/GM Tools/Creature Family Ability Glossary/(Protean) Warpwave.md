# (Protean) Warpwave

### 

**Category** offensive; 




Many proteans can subject their foes to disorienting alterations perceived in time and space by creating ripples of unstable reality in the environment called warpwaves. When a creature fails its saving throw and is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d8 and consult the table below for the specific effect on that creature. Unless indicated otherwise, a warpwave effect lasts for 1d4 rounds, and a new warpwave effect negates any previous warpwave effect already affecting a creature.

  

| 1d8 | Warpwave Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | [[Conditions/Clumsy 1\|Clumsy 2]] ([[Conditions/Clumsy 1\|Clumsy 3]] on a critical failure) |
| 2 | [[Conditions/Confused\|Confused]] and gains 4d6 temporary Hit Points |
| 3 | [[Conditions/Dazzled\|Dazzled]] (permanent on a critical failure) |
| 4 | [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1\|Enfeebled 2]] ([[Conditions/Enfeebled 1\|Enfeebled 3]] on a critical failure) |
| 5 | [[Conditions/Immobilized\|Immobilized]] by filaments of energy |
| 6 | [[Conditions/Quickened\|Quickened]] (Stride, Strike, or Step only) |
| 7 | [[Conditions/Slowed 1\|Slowed 1]] |
| 8 | [[Conditions/Stupefied 1\|Stupefied 2]] ([[Conditions/Stupefied 1\|Stupefied 3]] on a critical failure) |
