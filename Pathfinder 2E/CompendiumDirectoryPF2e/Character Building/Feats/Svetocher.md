# Svetocher
## Feat 1
### [[dhampir]][[lineage]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You were born to one of the moroi, the most common vampires, and you share their supernatural fortitude and power of persuasion.

When you have the [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained]] condition, calculate the penalty to your Fortitude saves and your Hit Point reduction as though the condition value were 1 lower.

You are trained Diplomacy. If you would automatically be trained in it, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
