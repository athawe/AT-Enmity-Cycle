# Sin Reservoir
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Runelord Dedication
* * *
During daily preparations, you can indulge in your associated sin. When you do, you gain one additional spell slot of any spell rank up to two levels below the highest-level wizard spell you can cast. You can prepare only a spell of your specialized school in this slot. As with any other act, indulging in your sin might change your alignment if your behavior harms someone else.
