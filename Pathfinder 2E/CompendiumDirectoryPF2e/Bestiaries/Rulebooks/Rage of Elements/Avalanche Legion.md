    desc: "  Whenever the avalanche legion Strides or Burrows, it first Forms Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves up to its respective Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the legion enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to all the elementals."

Elementals of the Plane of Earth can be fiercely territorial. Some more solitary elementals protect their lairs on their own, but occasionally others band together to defend larger regions that serve as shared turf. Notable among these alliances are avalanche legions, who patrol the perimeter of these shared territories, driving off intruders who dare to trespass upon their home ground.

## Familial Instincts

Although elementals don't reproduce like typical creatures, living landslides sometimes develop bonds with smaller or weaker earth elementals, such as earth wisps, living boulders, and sod hounds. When several of these smaller elementals are gathered in one place, living landslides who cared for the creatures often continue to watch over their wards. Avalanche legions sometimes form from these gatherings, as multiple living landslides join forces to protect the smaller elementals.
