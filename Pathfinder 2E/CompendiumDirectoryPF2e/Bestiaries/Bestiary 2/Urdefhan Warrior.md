The urdefhan chooses one of two options, each of which requires a DC 20 Fortitude check save. If the jaws Strike was a critical hit, the creature suffers both effects, using the same save result for both.\n\n*   **Drain Blood** The urdefhan drinks some of the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature is [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 1]] and the urdefhan regains 5 HP (or, on a critical failure, it's [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 2]] and the urdefhan regains 10 HP).\n*   **Drain Vitality** The urdefhan draws out some of the creature's vital essence. The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."

From the moment they are born, urdefhans are prepared for war. Urdefhan warriors are among the least powerful urdefhans one might encounter outside of their eerie underground cities.
