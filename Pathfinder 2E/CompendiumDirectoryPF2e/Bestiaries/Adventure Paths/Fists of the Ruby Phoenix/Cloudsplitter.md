    desc: " (aura,divine,emotion,mental) 60 feet. Creatures within Cloudsplitter's peaceful aura attempting to use a hostile action must first attempt a DC 39 Will check save; on a failure, the hostile action is disrupted.\n\nIf a creature in the aura successfully uses a hostile action, it's temporarily immune to peaceful aura for 24 hours, and while it's temporarily immune, other creatures in the Cloudsplitter's peaceful aura can perform hostile actions toward it without needing to attempt a Will save.\n\nCloudsplitter can select creatures within their aura that can use hostile actions without needing to attempt a Will save.\n\nCloudsplitter allows anyone involved in the player character's bout with Jin-Hae to use hostile actions without a Will save."
