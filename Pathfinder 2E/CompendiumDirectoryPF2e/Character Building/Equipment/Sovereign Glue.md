# Sovereign Glue
## Item 7
### [[alchemical]][[consumable]]

**Category** potion; 
**Price** 55 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

**Activate** 1 minute (Interact)

This peculiar amber glue bonds two surfaces together almost inseparably. A single flask covers an area up to 1 square foot and must be used all at once to form a single bond between two surfaces. If the activation is interrupted, the bond fails and the glue is wasted. Once two surfaces are joined with sovereign glue, they can be separated only with a successful DC 50 Athletics check check. The adhered objects tend to break before the glue does unless they're particularly durable, though a creature determined to separate the objects can break off the parts connected by the sovereign glue and later [[Actions/Repair|Repair]] the objects.

Sovereign glue can affect creatures only if they are willing, and its bond can be harmlessly broken by carefully exfoliating the outermost layer of skin or waiting a short while for the skin to shed.
