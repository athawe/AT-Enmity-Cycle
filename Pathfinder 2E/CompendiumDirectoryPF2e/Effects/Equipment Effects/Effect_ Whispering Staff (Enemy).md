# Effect: Whispering Staff (Enemy)
## Level 20
### 






Through the staff's strange whispering, you gain a glimpse into the mind and desires of one creature you can see within 30 feet. Until the end of your next turn, that creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to you and takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to saving throws against your spells.
