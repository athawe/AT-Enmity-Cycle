  - name: "Power Attack"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (flourish) Alak unleashes a particularly powerful attack that clobbers his foe but leaves him a bit unsteady. He makes a melee Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating his multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, he deals an extra die of weapon damage."
