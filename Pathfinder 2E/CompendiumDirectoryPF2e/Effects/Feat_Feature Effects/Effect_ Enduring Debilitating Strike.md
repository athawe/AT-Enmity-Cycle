# Effect: Enduring Debilitating Strike
## Level 1
### 






The target has been affected by a rogue's [[Actions/Debilitating Strike|Debilitating Strike]] if the rogue also has [[Feats/Enduring Debilitation|Enduring Debilitation]].

_Note: this effect only tracks the duration of the debilitation. You need to manually apply the specific penalties the rogue chose to apply._
