# Effect: Suit of Armoire Frustration
## Level 13
### 






On a failure, you and all creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 31 Will check save or be overcome with frustration at how you can't follow the simple, easy-to-understand diagrams for assembling the armoire, imposing a -1 status penalty to Will saves for 1 hour.
