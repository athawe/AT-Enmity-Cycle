The most powerful spawn is Tarrasque, whose legend spread across countless worlds beyond Golarion. Its destruction of the nation of Ninshabur and its march across Avistan in -632 AR culminated in the destruction of the flying Shory city of Kho before this spawn was sealed away in a remote cavern.

* * *

The spawn are titanic terrors of immense size and strength that live only to destroy. Tarrasque and Xotani are but two of Rovagug's spawn. Others, including Chemnosit (the Monarch Worm), Kothogaz (the Dance of Disharmony), and Volnagur (the End-Singer) hold places of horror in the history of various regions, but the most famed is Ulunat (the Unholy First), whose beetle-like carcass remains sprawled in Sothis, the capital of Osirion.
