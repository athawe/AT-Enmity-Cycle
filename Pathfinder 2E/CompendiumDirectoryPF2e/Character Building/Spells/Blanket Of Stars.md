    desc: "A flowing cloak of utter darkness drapes over you, filled with pinpricks of light like distant stars. It imparts the stillness of the cosmos to you, granting you a +2 status bonus to Stealth checks to [[Actions/Hide|Hide]] and [[Actions/Sneak|Sneak]].\n\nWhile outside under a starry night sky, you're also [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]] as long as you remain still. When moving under a starry night sky, you are [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] instead.\n\nGazing too closely into the stars is disorienting. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you must attempt a Will save; this is a mental, visual effect.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] until the end of its next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] and Dazzled until the end of its next turn."
