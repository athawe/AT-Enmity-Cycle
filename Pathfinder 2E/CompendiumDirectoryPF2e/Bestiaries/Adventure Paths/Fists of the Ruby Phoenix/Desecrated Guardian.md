Countless temples across Golarion, dedicated to deities both living and forgotten, have risen and fallen through the ages. Many find themselves buried under sand, snow, or vine never to be found. In such places, the spirits of the faithful can bind with their ruined temple to form a guardian construct, though with nothing left to guard, these spirits often become hollow, resentful, and filled with malice. These "desecrated guardians" lie in wait, sometimes for centuries, and destroy any adventurers who happen upon them. The most powerful desecrated guardians, such as the one presented here, incorporate the structures of multiple temples into their massive serpentine forms.
