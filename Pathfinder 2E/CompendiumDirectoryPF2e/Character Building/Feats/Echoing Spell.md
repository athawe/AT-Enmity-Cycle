# Echoing Spell `pf2:1`
## Feat 18
### [[concentrate]][[sorcerer]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 




You time the components of your spell with exacting precision, setting up a resonance that duplicates the spell's effects.

If your next action is to [[Actions/Cast a Spell|Cast a Spell]] of 4th level or lower that has no duration, the spell's energy reverberates and echoes. You can Cast the Spell a second time before the end of your next turn without expending a spell slot.
