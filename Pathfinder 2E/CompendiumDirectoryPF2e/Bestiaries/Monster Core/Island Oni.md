    desc: "  Oni are curiously afraid of beans, especially as the seasons begin to change. If a creature Interacts to throw a handful of beans at the oni, the oni becomes [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 2]]. While frightened this way, their weakness to spirit damage is increased by 5.

    desc: " (aura,primal) An island oni can claim an island of up to 1-mile radius in a process that takes 1 week, during which the oni must defeat any who come to challenge its claim. If successful, the oni can freely control the weather on its island and in a 1-mile radius from the shore, with the effect of a successful [[Spells/Control Weather|Control Weather]] ritual.\n\nThis altered weather surrounds the island in thick fog, seaborne mirages, or other phenomena that increase the DC of checks to locate and navigate to the island (Such as Sailing Lore or Survival) to 40, though the oni can allow allies to pass freely. If the oni dies or leaves the island, the weather returns to normal immediately."

Island oni are those powerful enough to claim small coastal islands, often creating makeshift armies of lesser oni who pillage surrounding lands and waters. Island oni hoard this material wealth, garbing themselves in luxurious clothing and adorning their monstrous faces with all manner of jewelry.

Island oni typically scavenge sunken shipwrecks for weapons, armor, and treasure. This can also bring them into contact with undead sailors, which island oni have been known to press into service.

Oni are large, brutal creatures originating in Tian Xia who resemble humanoids with brightly colored skin, tusks, and horns. Though commonly mistaken for fiends, the first oni were originally kami, tutelary nature spirits. These kami suffered a terrible trauma, losing their sacred wards to dramatic disasters or the callousness of others, and as a result transformed into the violent creatures they are today. While some believe that oni can be spiritually placated through proper ritual worship that transforms them back into kami, many of these would-be saviors fall to oni's notorious brute strength, flesh-rending teeth, and command of storms.

Oni possess the ability to disguise themselves as other humanoids. They are rarely creative in their disguises, often choosing a specific appearance similar to their oni form and sticking with it. This simplicity catches many by surprise, however, as people assume oni are limited to a single alternate form, which is by no means the case.
