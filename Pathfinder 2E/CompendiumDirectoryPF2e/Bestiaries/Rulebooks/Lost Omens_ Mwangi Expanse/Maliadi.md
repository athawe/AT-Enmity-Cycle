A maliadi resembles a massive hippopotamus surrounded by a collar of flame. Maliadis are arrogant and tyrannical, and demand tribute from everyone they encounter-whether lone travelers or entire villages-to avert destruction. Many pay them off, for maliadis can hurl parts of their flaming collars to form geysers of flame or fiery walls, and they're also powerful shapeshifters.
