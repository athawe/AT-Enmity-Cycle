# Clinging Shadows Initiate
## Feat 8
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** ki spells
* * *
You learn a mystical stance that transforms your ki into sticky smoke that shrouds your limbs, clinging to everything you touch.

You gain the [[Spells/Clinging Shadows Stance|Clinging Shadows Stance]] ki spell. Increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. While entering the stance uses a ki spell, the shadow grasp attacks it grants are not, so you can use them as often as you like while in the stance.
