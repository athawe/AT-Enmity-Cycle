Some forests are protected by kings, others only by wild things. Laws against hunting may protect the private reserves of nobles or guard the viability of animal populations of shared forests during specific seasons. Poachers violate those laws- sometimes out of greed, sometimes out of desperation, and sometimes for sport. Although penalties against poaching often include public shaming, in lean times a successful poacher is a local hero.

From the managed and cultivated forests that support villages to the tree-covered crown lands where only nobles and their servants are permitted to hunt, forests provide. To communities, forests provide fuel, food, medicine, and raw materials, while royally protected forests provide food for the nobles' table and a source of entertainment in the form of organized hunts. Even the ancient woods untouched by mortal hand or blade provide bards with settings where legends happened and could happen again. Many find the forest depths unsettling, but others live their lives among the trees and alongside the creatures that make their homes there.
