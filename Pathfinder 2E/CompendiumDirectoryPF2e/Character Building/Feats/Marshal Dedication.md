# Marshal Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in martial weapons and either Diplomacy or Intimidation
* * *
You've combined your social skills and combat training to become a talented combat leader. Choose Diplomacy or Intimidation. You become trained in that skill or become an expert if you were already trained in it.

In addition, you're surrounded by a marshal's aura in a 10-foot emanation. Your aura has the emotion, mental, and visual traits and grants you and allies within the aura a +1 status bonus to saving throws against fear.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Marshal|Marshal]] archetype.
