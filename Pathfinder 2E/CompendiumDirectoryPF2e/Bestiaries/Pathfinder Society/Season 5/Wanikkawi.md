  - name: "Demand Pact"
    desc: "`pf2:1` (auditory,linguistic,mental,occult) **Frequency** once per turn\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Wanikkawi attempts to force a creature within 30 feet that he is aware of to agree to a pact with him. The creature must attempt a DC 25 Will check save. Its effects depend on the variation; see below. Afterward, the creature gains temporary immunity for 1 day.\n* * *\n\nEach time you run this scenario, select one of the following variations to apply to Wanikkawi's Demand Pact ability:\n\n### Pact of Glory\n\nWanikkawi declares the target can attain fame by betraying their companions and staying out of the fight. He promises to let them survive the battle and claim that they drove him away despite the deaths of their friends. Demand Pact gains the following results:\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Wanikkawi's hatred for others overcomes him. He does not treat any other creatures as allies for 1 round.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature does not treat any other creature as an ally for 1 round. It doesn't become hostile but can't take an action (such as [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]] or Aid) or cast a spell to directly benefit any creature but itself. It doesn't count as an ally for the purposes of flanking.\n\n**Critical Failure** As above, but the creature also can't attack another creature. It can take actions that only target itself.\n\n### Pact of Survival\n\nWanikkawi suggests the PC can survive, as he did so many years ago, by [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] the fire. Demand Pact gains the following results:\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Wanikkawi remembers his own escape and must fight against that impulse. He gains a –10 status penalty to his speed for 1 round if he's in the firelight (–20 feet in bright light from the fire).\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is fleeing for a single action on its next turn.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is fleeing for 1 round.\n\n### Pact of Power\n\nWanikkawi promises power by transforming them into a spirit, like he was. Demand Pact gains the following results:\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** Wanikkawi becomes [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]] at the thought of his own transformation.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature takes on aspects of Wanikkawi's form for 1 minute. Because of this, if they enter or begin their turn in bright light caused by the fire, they become sickened 1 for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** As above, except the creature becomes sickened 1 if they enter or begin their turn in any light by the fire and [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] in bright light caused by the fire. This condition remains for 1 minute.\n\n### Pact of Erasure\n\nWanikkawi threatens the PC's true story will be forgotten, as his was. Demand Pact gains the following results:\n* * *\n\n**Critical Success** The truth of what Wanikkawi did suddenly hits him. He's unable to use reactions for 1 round.\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature becomes [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], inaudible, and otherwise imperceptible to its allies for 1 round.\n\n**Critical Failure** As above, but the creature's allies also forget about the creature for 1 round and can take no actions regarding the creature in that time. They remember the creature as usual after 1 round."

    desc: "`pf2:2`  **Requirements** Wanikkawi is [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]] to at least one enemy\n* * *\n\n**Effect** Wanikkawi Strides twice and makes a Strike against a creature he was hidden to at the start of his action at any point during his movement."
