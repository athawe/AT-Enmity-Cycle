# Contagious Rage
## Feat 20
### [[auditory]][[barbarian]][[rage]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Share Rage
* * *
You can drive your allies into a frenzy, granting them incredible benefits. You can ignore the requirements on [[Feats/Share Rage|Share Rage]], using it multiple times in a Rage. Allies affected by Share Rage who accept your anathema for the duration of the Rage gain your instinct ability and the specialization ability it gains from weapon specialization, but not greater weapon specialization.
