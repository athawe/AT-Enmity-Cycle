1. best **smith** in town. He works from his home in the [[Riverside Estates]].
2. Harsh of tongue to outsiders
3. The dwarves of [[Duwwor]] export the best ore, and control how much they sell to other city-states tightly. This keeps Aspenthar in check. Das personally objects with how they do things. 
4. He's angry because he feels that his talents are wasted here. But he knows how valuable he is, so he puts up with it. Would love to work with higher-grade materials and put out even better smithing than comes out of Duwwor.
