The target is cloaked in the freezing void, which deals 3d6 cold damage immediately and the first time each round you Sustain the Spell on future turns, with a basic Fortitude save.\n\nThe target is [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] for as long as the effect persists.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+1)** The cold damage increases by 1d6."
