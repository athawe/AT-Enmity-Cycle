- A theatrical troupe are nearing eviction from ? theatre. They haven't been able to keep up on rent and need someone to get their landlord to go easy on them while they try to get a new gig. There are 3 of them, a woman, a male gnome, and a female catfolk.
	- the PCs try to convince a grizzled landlord to not evict a theatrical troupe from a dilapidated building he owns. It’s a 3rd-level challenge. He is a busy, practical man and gives the PCs only 45 minutes (3 rounds) to make their case. 
	- [[Townsfolk#Danphy Mollwether|Danphy Mollwether]] LEVEL 3 
	- UNIQUE MEDIUM HUMAN HUMANOID 
	- Penny-pinching landlord 
	- **Perception** +9 
	- **Will** +12 
	- **Discovery** DC 13 Mercantile Lore, DC 18 Perception, DC 16 Society 
	- **Influence Skills** DC 16 Accounting Lore (noting how the theater could be made profitable), DC 16 Crafting (volunteering to repair the building), DC 20 Intimidation, DC 20 Performance, DC 22 Diplomacy, DC 24 Deception 
	- **Influence 4** Mr. Mollwether gives the troupe 1 week to get him his back rent, with interest, before evicting them. 
	- **Influence 6** Mr. Mollwether gives the troupe 1 month to get him his back rent before evicting them. 
	- **Influence 8** Mr. Mollwether allows the troupe to stay, reduces their rent, and forgives half their debt. 
	- **Resistances** The landlord thinks in practical terms, with little patience for the “good-for-nothings” of the troupe. Appeals directed at sympathy alone increase the check’s DC by 2. 
	- **Weaknesses** Mr. Mollwether used to visit the theater often as a small child, and performing one of his favorite old songs or plays brings tears to his eyes and reduces the Performance DC by 2. 
	- **Background** Mollwether was raised by wealthy parents who loved the arts and took him to the theater often. A scandal left the family broke, and Danphy clawed his way back up to a decent living. Becoming something of a slumlord, he owns several properties now and still feels he must exploit others to survive. 
	- **Appearance** An elderly man in cheap dress clothes, Mr. Mollwether looks like he’s never felt a moment of love for anyone in his entire life. 
	- **Personality** Impatient, crotchety, skeptical 
	- **Penalty** Antagonizing Mr. Mollwether by “sermonizing” or “wasting his time” causes him to cut the meeting short, reducing it to 2 rounds instead of 3.
