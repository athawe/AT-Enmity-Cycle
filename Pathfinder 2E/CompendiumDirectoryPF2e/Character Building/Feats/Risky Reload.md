# Risky Reload `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[flourish]][[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You're wielding a firearm.

* * *

You've practiced a technique for rapidly reloading your firearm, but attempting to use this technique is a dangerous gamble with your firearm's functionality. Interact to reload a firearm, then make a Strike with that firearm. If the Strike fails, the firearm misfires.
