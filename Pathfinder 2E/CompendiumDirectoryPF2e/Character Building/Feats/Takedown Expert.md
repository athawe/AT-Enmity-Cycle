# Takedown Expert
## Feat 1
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




You've mastered combat practices that let you get up close and bring down perpetrators alive.

You can use your Intelligence modifier on attack rolls when you [[Actions/Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Strategem]] if you're using a weapon of the club group in one hand (like a club, staff, or sap), in addition to the usual weapons, and those Strikes qualify for your [[Class Features/Strategic Strike|Strategic Strike]].

Additionally, you can make any of your Strikes nonlethal without taking the normal -2 penalty.
