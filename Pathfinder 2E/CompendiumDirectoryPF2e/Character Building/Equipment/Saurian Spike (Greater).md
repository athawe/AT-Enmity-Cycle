# Saurian Spike (Greater)
## Item 11
### [[magical]][[spellheart]]


**Price** 1400 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** affixed-to-armor-or-a-weapon

This jagged, bony growth narrows to a sharp, pointed tip. Deep groves from some former battle scar its surface. The bearer of a _saurian spike_ often feels a sudden surge in power and confidence.

*   **Armor** You gain imprecise scent with a range of 60 feet.
*   **Weapon**(auditory, emotion, fear, visual) When you cast a polymorph spell by activating the spike, your battle form is exceptionally fearsome. Each enemy in a 60-foot emanation must succeed at a DC 28 Will check saving throw or become [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 1]] ([[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 2]] on a critical failure).
