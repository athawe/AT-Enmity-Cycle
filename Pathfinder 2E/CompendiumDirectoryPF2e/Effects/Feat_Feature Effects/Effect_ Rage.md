# Effect: Rage
## Level 1
### 






**Requirements** You aren't [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] or raging

* * *

You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. This frenzy lasts for 1 minute, until there are no enemies you can perceive, or until you fall [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]], whichever comes first. You can't voluntarily stop raging. While you are raging:

*   You deal 2 additional damage with melee weapons and unarmed attacks. This additional damage is halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile.
*   You take a -1 penalty to AC.
*   You can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] while raging.

After you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and you can't Rage again for 1 minute.

Implemented Effects:

*   Temporary hitpoint based on level and con mod
*   Enables rage property for rage damage
*   Sets token effect
