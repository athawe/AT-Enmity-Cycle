# Engulfing Snare
## Item 14
### [[consumable]][[mechanical]][[snare]][[trap]]

**Category** snare; 
**Price** 900 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

You arrange a spiky cage of bones, particularly tough vegetation, or other material to spring up when disturbed. The snare deals 9d8 piercing damage to the first creature to enter this square; that creature must attempt a DC 31 Reflex check save.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is knocked aside by the snare's deployment, taking half damage, and is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the end of its next turn.

**Failure** The creature is captured by the cage, taking full damage and falling [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. It is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] while it remains within the cage. It can get free by [[Actions/Escape|Escaping]] (DC 31) or by destroying the cage (Hardness 5, HP 30, object immunities).

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage.
