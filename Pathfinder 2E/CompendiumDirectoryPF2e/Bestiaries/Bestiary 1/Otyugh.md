    desc: " (aura,olfactory) 40 feet. A creature entering the aura must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude check save or be [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]] (plus [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] for the same duration on a critical failure). On a success, the creature is temporarily immune to the sickened and slowed effects of this stench for 1 hour. Regardless of the save, while within the aura, creatures take a -2 circumstance penalty to saves against diseases. An otyugh's stench is due to the offal and refuse that it wallows in, so cleaning the creature thoroughly (with [[Spells/Create Water|Create Water]] and sufficient scrubbing, for example) deactivates the aura, while a sufficiently plugged nose allows an individual to avoid exposure to the stench.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Stench|Effect: Stench]]"

Lords of sewers, ditches, and landfllls, otyughs are filthy monstrosities that stomp about on three massive legs in search of tasty garbage and refuse. Using two barbed tentacles to grasp and tear, guided by a third with a proliferation of eyes at the end, the otyugh has perfectly adapted to life in its cramped, disgusting environment, where it uses its appendages to see into tight spaces and grasp hidden prey.

Most assume that otyughs originally evolved in swamps and moved into sewers as civilization encroached on their natural habitats. True or not, they are now one of the larger predators in those dank environs. Otyughs are territorial, but they have been known to form loose collectives, even giving each other important-sounding titles like 'king of offal'; and 'duchess of slime' to indicate their rank and station in their sludgy underworld beneath the streets.

Those who run across an otyugh might be surprised to hear it speak, shouting at intruders to leave its putrid home or demanding tribute in the form of trash or other prizes of dubious nature.
