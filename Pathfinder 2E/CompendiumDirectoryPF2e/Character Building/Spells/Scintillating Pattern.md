    desc: "A field of cascading, ever-changing colors manifests in the air. Creatures are [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] while inside the pattern, as are those within 20 feet of the pattern's area. A creature must attempt a Will save if it is inside the pattern when you cast it, enters the pattern, ends its turn within the pattern, or uses a Seek or Interact action on the pattern. A creature currently affected by the pattern doesn't need to attempt new saves.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] for 1d4 rounds.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Stunned 1|Stunned]] for 1d4 rounds. After the Stunned condition ends, the creature is Confused for the remaining duration of the spell."
