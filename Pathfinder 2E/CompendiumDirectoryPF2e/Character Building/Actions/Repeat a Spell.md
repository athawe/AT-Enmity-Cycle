# Repeat a Spell

### [[concentrate]][[exploration]]

**Category** interaction; 




You repeatedly cast the same spell while moving at half speed. Typically, this spell is a cantrip that you want to have in effect in the event a combat breaks out, and it must be one you can cast in 2 actions or fewer. In order to prevent fatigue due to repeated casting, you'll likely use this activity only when something out of the ordinary occurs.

You can instead use this activity to continue [[Actions/Sustain|Sustain a Spell]] or [[Actions/Sustain|Sustain]] with a sustained duration. Most such spells or item effects can be sustained for 10 minutes, though some specify they can be sustained for a different duration.
