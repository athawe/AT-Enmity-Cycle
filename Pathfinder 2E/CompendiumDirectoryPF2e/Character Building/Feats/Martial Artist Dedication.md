# Martial Artist Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 




You have trained to use your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist unarmed attacks becomes 1d6 instead of 1d4. You don't take the -2 circumstance penalty for making a lethal attack with your nonlethal unarmed attacks.

Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in certain weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank in all unarmed attacks.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Martial Artist|Martial Artist]] archetype.
