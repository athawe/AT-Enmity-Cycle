# Blessings of the Five `pf2:3`

### [[concentrate]][[divine]][[healing]][[manipulate]][[vitality]]

**Category** bonus; 



**Prerequisites** Order of the Godclaw
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

You call out to the Godclaw to heal your allies. You cast the 3-action version of heal, heightened to a level 1 lower than half your level rounded up. You can select up to four creatures in the area to remain unaffected by the spell. You can instead use this ability to bring a creature within 30 feet that has died within the last round back from the dead. If you do, the creature is restored to 1 Hit Point and is doomed 1 for 24 hours.
