# Linguist's Dictionary (Greater)
## Item 12
### [[grimoire]][[magical]]


**Price** 1750 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Bound in sturdy leather, this thick book has several colorful bookmarks and page dividers. Its title and text shift between numerous languages.

**Activate** `pf2:0` envision

**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** Your last action was to cast a spell prepared from this grimoire that allows understanding of another language, such as [[Spells/Translate|Translate]] or [[Spells/Truespeech|Truespeech]]

* * *

**Effect** The grimoire absorbs knowledge of one language translated this way (caster's choice if more than one), allowing its bearer to communicate on a rudimentary level in that language even after the spell's duration has elapsed. The _greater linguist's dictionary_ can hold three languages at a time.
