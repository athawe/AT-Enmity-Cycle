# Smoke Bomb `pf2:0`
## Feat 2
### [[additive1]][[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per round

**Trigger** You use [[Class Features/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] to craft an alchemical bomb with a level at least 1 lower than your advanced alchemy level

* * *

You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke, in addition to its normal effects.

When thrown, the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst. You choose which corner of the target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on.

Creatures within that area have the [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] condition, and all other creatures are concealed to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.
