# Alseta - Major Curse

### 






**Major Curse:** Transportation magic no longer works for you. You cannot be transported by any magical means, nor can you transport, conjure, or summon others. Even extradimensional spaces like bags of holding are inaccessible and unusable to you, as using them requires magical transportation to the extradimensional space.
