Burglars specialize in breaking and entering to rob homes and businesses. These criminals focus on gaining access to secure buildings and bypassing traps and other security measures while remaining undetected all the while.

* * *

Some criminals are the desperate who have no option but to break the law to survive, while others choose a life of crime for thrills, forming gangs or underworld guilds that specialize in certain illegal ventures.
