Solars are among the greatest of all angels, ranking just below empyreal lords. Many solars serve at the right hand of a deity or champion a cause that benefits an entire world. Most archangels resemble humanoids, but not all-they can adopt more unusual forms as needed. A typical solar is about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.

Solars are legendary trackers; the most masterful of them are said to be able to follow the centuries-old passage of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane.

Angels are benevolent messengers who aid good forces in the fight against evil. Each angel has a special aura that assists in their individual tasks, and each angel delivers certain types of messages and performs other duties for the angelic hosts. While most angels live in the enlightened realm of Nirvana, some serve the forces of Heaven and Elysium, especially in the case of the angel empyreal lords within those two realms. Angels organize themselves into choirs depending on their ranks and roles.
