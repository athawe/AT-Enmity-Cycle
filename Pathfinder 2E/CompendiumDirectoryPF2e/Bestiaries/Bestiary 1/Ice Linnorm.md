    desc: "`pf2:2` (cold,primal) The ice linnorm spews out a blast of freezing, viscous ooze in a 60-foot cone that deals 15d6 cold damage to creatures within the area (DC 38 Reflex check save). The freezing ooze clings to those struck and hardens into thick sheets of ice. A creature that fails the saving throw is [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]] by the ice until it succeeds at a check to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]] or it or an ally [[Actions/Force Open|Forces Open]] the ice (DC 34 for either case). At the start of its turn, a creature still immobilized by the ice takes 4d6 cold damage. Another creature can free a frozen target by dealing a total of 20 fire damage to the frozen target. Left unattended, the ice crumbles away in 1 minute on its own. Creatures with the fire trait can't be frozen in place by this breath weapon. Flying creatures fall if frozen, and swimming creatures that are frozen rise toward the surface of the water at a speed of 60 feet per round.\n\nAn ice linnorm can't use Breath Weapon again for 1d4 rounds."

The ice linnorm dwells amid glacial crevasses, atop wind-blasted mountain peaks, or within glittering caverns carved from the hearts of the mightiest of icebergs.

Immense, primeval dragons of the northern reaches of the world, linnorms hate those they deem to be lesser creatures and seek to inflict as much suffering as possible upon their unfortunate victims. While these serpentine monstrosities might not be the powerful winged dragons most imagine, they nonetheless possess incredible strength and deadly powers that often rival authentic dragon brutality.
