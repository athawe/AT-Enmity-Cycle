    desc: "  Lemures have little drive of their own, but other devils can take command of them. A non-lemure devil can issue a command to all lemures within 60 feet of it with a single action, which has the auditory and concentrate traits. The devil picks one of the following orders lemures can understand, and the lemures follow that order. The command and its effects end once the commander is out of the lemure's sight, a new command is issued by the same or another devil, or the lemure dies.\n\n*   **Kill** The lemure attacks one target the commander singles out and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls against the target.\n*   **Defend** The lemure circles the commander and attacks any creature that comes near. It gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saves.\n*   **Fetch** The lemure gains a +10-foot circumstance bonus to its Speed and attempts to get an object or person the commander singles out. It attacks anyone and anything that gets in the way.\n*   **Work** The lemure performs drudge work dictated by the commander."

These shapeless masses of quivering flesh are the least of devilkind. Pathetic creatures from Hell's first layer, lemures roam alongside damned and suffering souls. Pit fiends can combine the essence of a mob of lemures to concentrate their collective wickedness with a single form, granting it an infernal sentience and transforming it into a more powerful devil (see the pit fiend's Devil Shaping ability).

* * *

Masters of corruption and architects of conquest, devils seek both to tempt mortal life to join in their pursuit of all things profane and to spread tyranny throughout all worlds. The temptations they offer mortals range from great powers granted by the signing of an infernal contract to twisted favors following a whispered pledge to a diabolic patron, or any number of even subtler exchanges. Those who succumb to these temptations find themselves consigned to an afterlife of endless torment in the pits of Hell, wherein the only hope of escape lies in the chance of being promoted to become a devil in the infernal ranks. Every devil has a specific role to play in the upkeep of the remorseless bureaucratic machine that is Hell, from soldiers and scholars to inquisitors, lawyers, judges, and executioners. Lowly lemures and imps perform subservient labor to more powerful and specialized devils, such as contract devils and erinyes, while the greatest pit fiends command entire infernal armies.
