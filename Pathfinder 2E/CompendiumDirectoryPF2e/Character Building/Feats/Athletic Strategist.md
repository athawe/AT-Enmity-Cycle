# Athletic Strategist
## Feat 2
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Athletics
* * *
You know how to calculatedly manipulate joints and body weight. In addition to using [[Actions/Devise a Stratagem|Devise a Strategem]] to modify a Strike, you can use it to modify a [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Actions/Grapple|Grapple]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]] attempt, substituting your Devise a Stratagem roll for the Athletics check. You must apply the substitution to the first eligible attack you make, whether it's a Strike or one of the Athletics actions.

You can also use your Intelligence modifier instead of Strength for the Athletics check when you substitute your Devise a Stratagem roll, unless you're using a weapon for the maneuver and the weapon doesn't fit the restrictions for using Intelligence with a stratagem.
