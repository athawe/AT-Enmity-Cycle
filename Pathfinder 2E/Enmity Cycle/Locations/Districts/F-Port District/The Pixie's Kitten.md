The Other Hand HOUSING MERCHANT PARLOR 
**District** Port District 
Lamasaraâ€™s brothel also rents rooms out to travelers seeking a safe, secure, and secret place to rest. 
**Wares** whores, lodging 
**"Dice"** (NE male human noble (pimp) 5; friendly; *Perception DC 21, Will DC 21*)
- smooth talker, always hoping for a nice payday on someone dumb enough to get too drunk to keep track of their coin.
**Kaye Hemlock** (CE female human rogue 4; indifferent; *Perception DC 20, Will DC 23*) 
- She's the most expensive doxy in the brothel
- Former wife to the Sheriff, she still uses his name even after the divorce. 
- It causes him great embarrassment and shame. 
- She made a deal with a succubus years ago to enhance her sexual prowess, her end of the bargain is to cause him as much suffering as possible. But she consciously enjoys his humiliation.

If the Sheriff doesn't get pushed over the edge by the party, then he may go raid this whore house to lock up his ex. Rescue mission?
