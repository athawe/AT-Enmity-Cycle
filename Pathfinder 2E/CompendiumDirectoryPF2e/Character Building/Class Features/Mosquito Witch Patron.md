# Mosquito Witch Patron
## Feat 1
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[witch]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Few in Shimmerford or elsewhere would be foolish enough to attempt to draw the Mosquito Witch's attention, but whether you're one of those foolish few or simply someone who attracted the Mosquito Witch's attention unwittingly or unwillingly, she grants you powers over insects and other arthropods.

**Spell List** primal

**Patron Skill** Nature

**Hex Cantrip** [[Spells/Buzzing Bites|Buzzing Bites]]

**Granted Spell** [[Spells/Pest Form|Pest Form]]

**Familiar of Ongoing Misery** Your familiar seems hostile to all creatures other than you, hissing at them if they get too near. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar can curse a creature within 15 feet of it, prolonging the duration of any negative conditions affecting it by 1 round. This is a curse effect. This prolongs only conditions with a timed duration (such as "1 round" or "until the end of your next turn") and doesn't prevent conditions from being removed by other means.

_Note: This patron's familiar ability was added per PFS guidelines._
