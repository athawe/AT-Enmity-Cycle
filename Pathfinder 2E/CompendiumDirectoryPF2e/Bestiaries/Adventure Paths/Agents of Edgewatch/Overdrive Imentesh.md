    desc: " (divine,prediction) An overdrive imentesh can anticipate the most likely location of a creature through their supernatural insight into the forces of chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants the overdrive imentesh the ability to sense creatures within the listed range.\n\nThe overdrive imentesh's entropy sense doesn't detect creatures under the effects of [[Spells/Veil of Privacy|Veil of Privacy]] or that are otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions."

  - name: "Protean Anatomy"
    desc: " (divine) A overdrive imentesh's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly.\n\nImmediately after the hegessik takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first.\n\nThe overdrive imentesh is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]], the overdrive imentesh automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones."
