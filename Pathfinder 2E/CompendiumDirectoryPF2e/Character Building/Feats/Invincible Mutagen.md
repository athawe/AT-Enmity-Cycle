# Invincible Mutagen
## Feat 12
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




Repeated exposure to fortifying additives in mutagens makes your juggernaut form impervious.

Whenever you're affected by a [[Equipment/Juggernaut Mutagen (Lesser)|Juggernaut Mutagen]], you gain resistance to all physical damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0).
