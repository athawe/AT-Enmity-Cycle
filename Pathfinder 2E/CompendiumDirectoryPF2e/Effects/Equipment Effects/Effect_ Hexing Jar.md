# Effect: Hexing Jar
## Level 1
### 






The thing in the _hexing jar_ becomes more energeticâ€”glowing, dancing, rapping on the glass, or some other action appropriate to its appearance. It encourages you until the start of your next turn, granting you and your familiar a +1 status bonus to AC and saving throws and a +2 status bonus against mental effects.
