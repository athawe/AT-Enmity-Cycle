Although the mysterious demigods known as the Forsaken disappeared eons ago, many calignis continue to follow their ancient traditions of worship.

Owbs, once the Forsaken's servants, still respond to caligni prayers. Caligni callers serve as the priests of their communities, calling upon these shadowy owb patrons for guidance, favors, and power. Their most important ceremony, the blanching, determines the potential of most newborn calignis and shapes their eventual forms.

Due to their close ties to the malevolent owbs, most callers exhibit cruel and inscrutable natures. They often lead caligni enclaves alongside caligni stalkers as spiritual advisors. Callers tend to be highly superstitious, seeing omens everywhere, and they avoid revealing details of their rituals even to other calignis.

* * *

Each individual in caligni society serves a specific role. At times, certain roles so rarely find suitable candidates that a community might only see a few individuals fill them in an entire generation.
