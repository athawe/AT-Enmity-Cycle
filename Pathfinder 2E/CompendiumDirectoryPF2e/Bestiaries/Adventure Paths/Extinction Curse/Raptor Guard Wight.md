    desc: " (divine) A living humanoid slain by a Raptor Guard wight's melee Strike rises as a [[Bestiary 1/Wight|Wight]] after 1d4 rounds. This wight spawn is under the command of the Raptor Guard that killed it. It doesn't have the drain life or wight spawn abilities and is [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 2]]. If the creator of the wight spawn dies, the wight spawn becomes a full-fledged, autonomous wight; it regains its free will, gains the drain life and wight spawn abilities, and is no longer clumsy."
