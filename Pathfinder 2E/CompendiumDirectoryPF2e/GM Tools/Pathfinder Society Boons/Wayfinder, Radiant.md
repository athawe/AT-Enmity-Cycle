# Wayfinder, Radiant `pf2:2`

### 

**Category** pfsboon; 




**\[Item\]**

**Prerequisites** Liked by Radiant Oath; You own a _[[Equipment/Wayfinder|Wayfinder]]_

**Action** `pf2:2` command

* * *

**Effect** The _wayfinder_ glows with a spiritual radiance, revealing that which is [[Conditions/Hidden|Hidden]]. This has the effects of [[Spells/Faerie Fire|Faerie Fire]], except the effect occurs in a 10-foot radius centered around you.

You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the _wayfinder_ at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a DC 10 Flat check. On a success, the _wayfinder_ is broken. On a failure, the _wayfinder_ is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a _wayfinder_ that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.

* * *

**Special** You can apply multiple upgrades to a single _wayfinder_. Each upgrade only affects one _wayfinder_ in your possession, chosen when the boon is purchased. If a _wayfinder_ has multiple upgrades on it, you can only safely use each ability once per scenario.

If the _wayfinder_ with this upgrade is destroyed, you can apply the upgrade to another _wayfinder_ during Downtime for no additional cost beyond that of the _wayfinder_ itself.
