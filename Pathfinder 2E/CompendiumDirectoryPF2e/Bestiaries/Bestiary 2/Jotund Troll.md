  - name: "Head Regrowth"
    desc: "  A jotund troll ordinarily has nine heads, and they can use regeneration to regrow a head that is severed from an effect like a [[Equipment/Vorpal|Vorpal]] weapon. After regaining Hit Points from regeneration, the jotund troll attempts a DC 8 Flat check check. On a success, one missing head is fully restored; on a critical success, two missing heads are fully restored. If a jotund troll loses their last remaining head, they die immediately."

  - name: "Multiple Opportunities"
    desc: "  A jotund troll gains an extra reaction per round for each of their heads beyond the first, which they can use only to make Attacks of Opportunity with their jaws or to Fast Swallow. They can't use more than 1 reaction for the same triggering action, even if a creature leaves several squares within their reach, and the jotund troll must use a different head for each Attack of Opportunity they make. Whenever one of the jotund troll's heads is severed, the troll loses 1 of their extra reactions per round."

Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors who prowl frigid moors, marshes, and wastelands, always alone and always enraged. While each of the jotund troll's nine heads possess their own brains and senses, they work much more in tandem than the dual-minded nature of the two-headed troll. Despite this, the heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little difference in such culinary disagreements.

Prevailing wisdom holds that the jotund troll represents a primordial, if not original, shape and design for the first trolls to plague the world, arising from a mythical realm in the Great Beyond known as Jotungard. This sprawling domain, said to be nestled in a remote reach of Elysium, is the legendary home of the deities of giant-kind. Whether the jotund troll was created in Jotungard to plague the Material Plane as punishment or challenge, or if it's merely an evocative legend told by scholars, is unknown. In any case, the jotund trolls themselves likely care little.
