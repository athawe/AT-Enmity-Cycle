The corpse it leaves behind is little more than a husk."

    desc: "`pf2:3` (manipulate) While most vermleks inhabit Medium humanoids, Urxehl has granted this demon the ability to inhabit centaurs instead.\n\nThe vermlek crawls into the body of an adjacent dead centaur, consuming the bulk of the victim's skeleton and internal organs as it does so and cramming itself into the cavity.\n\nThe vermlek can wield weapons and use the centaur's Speed, hoof attack, and Trample ability. It also gains a +3 circumstance bonus to AC. While Inhabiting a Centaur body, a vermlek can't burrow.\n\nIt can't use this ability if it's already Inhabiting a Centaur Body."

On a critical failure, the creature is frightened 1 and [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]].\n\nRegardless of the result, creatures are immune to the same vermlek's unsettling movement for 24 hours."
