# Shake it Off `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[barbarian]][[concentrate]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 




You concentrate on your rage, overcoming fear and fighting back sickness. Reduce your [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened]] condition value by 1, and attempt a Fortitude save to recover from the [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened]] condition as if you had spent an action retching; you reduce your sickened condition value by 1 on a failure (but not on a critical failure), by 2 on a success, or by 3 on a critical success.
