# Spiritual Guides `pf2:r`
## Feat 4
### [[barbarian]][[concentrate]][[fortune]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** spirit instinct
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** You fail, but don't critically fail, a Perception check or a skill check.

* * *

Though no one sees them and only you can hear them, the spirits around you constantly chatter, save when you are raging. Sometimes they're even helpful. You can heed the spirits' guidance to reroll the triggering check, using the second result even if it's worse.
