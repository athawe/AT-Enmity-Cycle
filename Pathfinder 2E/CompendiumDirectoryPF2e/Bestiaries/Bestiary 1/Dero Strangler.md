Dero stranglers specialize in capturing living victims, and they are often called upon to aid in abductions.

Deros are short, wiry humanoids with milky white eyes, gray-blue skin, and wild shocks of off-white or gray hair. The descendants of a mysterious type of fey abandoned in the deepest, darkest caverns of Golarion, deros are the subject of fearful legends and folk tales to most of the world's surface races. They skulk beneath major metropolitan areas, performing cruel and twisted experiments on unwilling subjects. A dero is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 70 pounds.
