# Effect: Emblazon Antimagic (Weapon)
## Level 12
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Emblazon Antimagic|Emblazon Antimagic]].

When the weapon's wielder critically hits with the weapon, they can attempt to counteract a spell on their target, using half their level, rounded up, as the counteract rank. If they attempt to do so, the emblazoned symbol immediately disappears.
