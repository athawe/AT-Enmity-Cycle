# Red Herring
## Feat 2
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




You have a keen sense for avoiding spurious lines of inquiry. When you [[Actions/Pursue a Lead|Pursue a Lead]], the GM tells you if the lead you chose is inconsequential.

For example, if you found a splatter of gray mud on the wall, thought it was suspicious, and Pursued it as a Lead, the GM would tell you if there was no greater mystery related to it.

When the GM tells you a lead is inconsequential, you can decline to Pursue the Lead, keeping any leads you were already pursuing. You still can't use Pursue a Lead again for 10 minutes, as normal.
