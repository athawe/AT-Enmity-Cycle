# Disrupt Ki `pf2:2`
## Feat 12
### [[monk]][[void]]

**Category** class; 




Make an unarmed Strike. If it deals damage to a living creature, you block that creature's inner life force.

The creature takes 2d6 persistent void damage and is [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]] until the persistent damage ends.

If you're 18th level or higher, this deals 3d6 persistent void damage instead.
