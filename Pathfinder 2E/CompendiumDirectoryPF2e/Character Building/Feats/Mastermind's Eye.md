# Mastermind's Eye
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Butterfly Blade Dedication
* * *
When you succeed at identifying a creature using Recall Knowledge, that creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against your attacks until the start of your next turn; if you critically succeed, it's off-guard against your attacks for 1 minute. This feat serves as the rogue's mastermind racket for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.
