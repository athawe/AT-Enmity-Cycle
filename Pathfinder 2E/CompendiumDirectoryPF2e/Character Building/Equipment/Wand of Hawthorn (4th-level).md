## Item 10
### [[magical]][[wand]]


**Price** 1000 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

Carved from a hawthorn branch, this wand has a smooth handle, but the shaft remains covered in bark and long thorns. Polished red stones, arranged like a cluster of berries, decorate the pommel.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast 4th-rank [[Spells/Oaken Resilience|Oaken Resilience]], and the target sprouts long thorns like those of a hawthorn tree. While [[Spells/Oaken Resilience|Oaken Resilience]] lasts, any creature that hits the target with an unarmed Strike or otherwise touches it takes 2d4 piercing damage from the thorns. A creature that has engulfed or swallowed the target takes this damage as well at the start of each of the target's turns.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of [[Spells/Oaken Resilience|Oaken Resilience]] of the appropriate rank.
