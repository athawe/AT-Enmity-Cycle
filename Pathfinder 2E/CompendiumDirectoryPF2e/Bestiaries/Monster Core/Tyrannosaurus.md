Widely regarded as the king of the dinosaurs, the tyrannosaurus is a massive predator with a wide mouth filled with viciously sharp teeth. Some tribes of giants have even trained tyrannosauruses as mounts or beasts of war.

* * *

Remnants from the world's primeval era, these enormous reptilian animals still exist in large numbers in remote wildernesses or underground in magical Darklands caverns. Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other humanoids who live near dinosaurs use the animals as mounts, guards, or hunting beasts. Occasionally, rich nobles will collect dinosaurs to display them in menageries, which almost inevitably leads to cast-offs being nursed back to health by druids and other champions of nature. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions outside their normal habitats, it's often the result of a large collection being released.
