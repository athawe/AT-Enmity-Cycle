# Dual Onslaught
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Dual-Weapon Dedication
* * *
When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack.

When you use [[Feats/Double Slice|Double Slice]], if you miss with both [[Actions/Strike|Strikes]], choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon.

You can't choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.
