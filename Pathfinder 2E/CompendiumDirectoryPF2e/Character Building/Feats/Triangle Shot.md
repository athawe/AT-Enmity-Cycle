# Triangle Shot `pf2:2`
## Feat 18
### [[concentrate]][[flourish]][[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Monastic Archer Stance; Stunning Fist
* * *
**Requirements** You are in [[Feats/Monastic Archer Stance|Monastic Archer Stance]] and wielding a bow usable with that stance.

* * *

You string three arrows to your bow and fire them all at once. Make three ranged Strikes against a single target with the required weapon, each using your current multiple attack penalty, and you take an additional -2 penalty. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty, and you combine the attacks' damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.

Your [[Feats/Stunning Fist|Stunning Fist]] benefit applies to Triangle Shot, even though it isn't a [[Actions/Flurry of Blows|Flurry of Blows]]. If all three Strikes hit, the target takes 3d6 bleed.
