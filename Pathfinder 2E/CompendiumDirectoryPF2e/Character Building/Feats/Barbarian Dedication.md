# Barbarian Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]][[multiclass]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Strength +2; Constitution +2
* * *
You become trained in Athletics; if you were already trained in Athletics, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You become trained in barbarian class DC. You can use the [[Actions/Rage|Rage]] action. Choose an [[Class Features/Instinct|Instinct]] as you would if you were a barbarian. You have that instinct for all purposes and become bound by its anathema, but you don't gain any of the other abilities it grants.

* * *

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Barbarian|Barbarian]] archetype.
