# Winter Sleet `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [[cold]][[impulse]][[kineticist]][[primal]][[stance]][[water]]

**Category** class; 




Bone-chilling, swirling sleet surrounds you, cruel as deepest winter. Surfaces in your kinetic aura are coated in slippery ice. A creature that moves on this uneven ground immediately falls unless it [[Actions/Balance|Balances]] (DC 15). A creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] on the ice, as normal for uneven ground. You're immune to these effects.

If a creature on the ice is critically hit by one of your water impulses or critically fails at a save against one, that creature is [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] until the end of its next turn.
