# Antipaladin
## Feat 1
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You're dishonorable, dishonest, and committed to breaking the false hopes of kindness. You gain the [[Actions/Destructive Vengeance|Destructive Vengeance]] champion's reaction and the [[Spells/Touch of Corruption|Touch of Corruption]] devotion spell. You gain the follow edicts and anathema:

**Edicts** destroy that which offends you or stands in your way, take advantage of others, cheat, steal

**Anathema** bind yourself with a law other than what your deity requires

## Divine SmiteLevel 9

An enemy damaged by the initial damage from your Destructive Vengeance also takes persistent spirit damage equal to your Charisma modifier. This applies only to the damage the reaction itself deals to the triggering creature, not the damage you deal with subsequent [[Actions/Strike|Strikes]].

## ExaltLevel 11

When you use Destructive Vengeance, each enemy within 15 feet of you other than the triggering creature takes half the damage you deal to the triggering enemy, of the same damage type you chose.
