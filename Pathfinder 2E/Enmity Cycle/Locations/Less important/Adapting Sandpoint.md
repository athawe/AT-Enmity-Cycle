**Abstalar Zantus** (CG male human cleric of Desna 7) town priest 
**Belor Hemlock** (CG human male fighter 5) sheriff 
**Kendra Deverin** (NG female human politician 7) mayor 
## Lamasara’s Factions 
Each of these factions represent groups with which the PCs can build reputation—but as ever in matters political, earning favor with one faction can earn the hatred of another. 
**The Other Hand**: Deyad's group 
**Runewatchers**: The newest group to rise to power in town are the loosely affiliated Runewatchers. Ever since Thuvia’s legacy leapt to the forefront of Varisia’s international reputation (triggered in no small part by events that took place right here in town 17 years prior), the Runewatchers have collected lore and tales about old Thuvia while also keeping an eye out for new problems associated with the ancient nation’s legacy. The Runewatchers meet on the first day of each season at Brodert Quink’s home (area 8) to share rumors and news—gatherings that have mostly become glorified social visits of late. 
**Lamasara Cathedral**: Lamasara’s current religious leader is Abstalar Zantus, an elderly man who, it’s rumored, is eager to retire and pass the proverbial torch to a new priest. The cathedral itself is the largest building in town (area 1). 
**Lamasara Mercantile League**: The oldest faction in town is the Lamasara Mercantile League. Originally consisting of members from the town’s four founding families, the Mercantile League today counts most of Lamasara’s shopkeepers, innkeepers, and providers among their number. The Lamasara Mercantile League bases its operations out of a large building near the town’s waterfront (area 40). 
**Lingering Note**: Kylas' group. Run from his manor (area 48). 
**Town Watch**: Sheriff Belor Hemlock continues to command the Town Watch, although he’s increasingly relied upon the assistance of his wife Kaye Tesarani to handle the delicate matters of politics and public relations. The Town Watch patrols both the settlement’s streets and the roads through its hinterlands, and are responsible for the safety of the citizens. The Town Watch is based out of the Lamasara garrison (area 10). 
**Townsfolk**: Finally, there are the townsfolk themselves, ably represented by their mayor, Kendra Deverin. Kendra keeps a manor to the south of town, but the business of running Lamasara and seeing to the needs of its people are focused in the town hall (area 11).

### EARNING REPUTATION 
The party earns reputation for these seven factions as a group, not as individual PCs; GMs should keep track of the PCs’ current reputation category and current Reputation Points publicly, so the players always know where they stand with the seven factions. The party’s starting Reputation Points for each faction are listed below, along with any advantages and disadvantages for each tier of reputation (if a tier is not listed, then no advantage or disadvantage is gained at that tier). Reputation Points can be earned or lost as the GM sees fit.

|                |                       |                         |                              |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Reputation** | **Reputation Points** | **Raised By**           | **Lowered By**               |
| **Revered**    | 30 to 50              | Major favor             | Moderate or major disservice |
| **Admired**    | 15 to 29              | Major favor             | Any disservice               |
| **Liked**      | 5 to 14               | Moderate or major favor | Any disservice               |
| **Ignored**    | –4 to 4               | Any favor               | Any disservice               |
| **Disliked**   | –5 to –14             | Any favor               | Moderate or major disservice |
| **Hated**      | –15 to –29            | Any favor               | Major disservice             |
| **Hunted**     | –30 to –50            | Moderate or major favor | Major disservice             |

### The Other Hand
A band of criminals who want to see Lamasara thrive so they can profit from the shadows. 
Starting Reputation Points –4 
**Revered**
If the PCs are at least 9th level, club members are willing to oust Jubrayl as their leader to install one (or more) of the PCs in his place, leading to a Severe encounter against Jubrayl and a few of his remaining loyalists; if Jubrayl is defeated, the PCs take command of the The Other Hand (see area 42 for details). 
**Admired** 
Once a month, if a PC is arrested, the The Other Hand pulls strings to get them out of jail. 
**Liked** If the PCs haven’t been invited to join the club, they are at this time (see area 42). 
**Disliked** 
Members of the The Other Hand sometimes mock the PCs or toss insults their way in public. 
**Hated** 
The insults grow more common and cruel; PCs are targeted more often by robberies or even muggings. 
**Hunted**
The The Other Hand arranges a hit on the party, sending a group of hired bandits to attack them at some point when they’re on their way out to the Pit; this should be a Severe encounter of the GM’s design. If the PCs defeat the bandits, the The Other Hand sends another out to get them once every 1d4 months as long as they remain **Hunted**. 
https://www.dndspeak.com/2022/11/23/100-thieves-guild-quests/
### RUNEWATCHERS 
Scholars interested in trading lore about ancient Thuvia, and who keep an eye out for ancient dangers. 
Starting Reputation Points 4 
**Revered** 
The Runewatchers make a donation to the party in the form of an Endless Grimoire (Pathfinder Secrets of Magic 162) with the Sihedron emblazoned on its cover. 
**Admired** 
The Runewatchers are so impressed with the PCs that they decide to share their greatest secrets with them. This unlocks access to the Runescarred archetype (Pathfinder Lost Omens World Guide 119) and the Ritualist archetype (Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide 187) for the PCs. Items purchased from the Runewatchers now have a 10% discount. 
**Liked** 
The Runewatchers invite the PCs to take part in their gatherings, and are also willing to offer some of the magic items from their collection for sale. GMs should build a small list of magic items of 8th-level or lower, curated to be useful for the PCs, for them to consider purchasing. **Hated** 
The Runewatchers spread rumors about the PCs as being potential agents of Runelord Belimarius, resulting in a –1 penalty to all Diplomacy checks made in town. 
**Hunted** 
The Runewatchers’ rumor-spreading has gone so far that a group of unscrupulous adventurers takes it upon themselves to track the PCs down and ambush them while they’re emerging from the Pit. This should be a Severe encounter of the GM’s design against a group of four foes. If the adventurers are defeated, a new group seeks them out once every 1d4 months they remain at this level with the Runewatchers.
### Lamasara CATHEDRAL 
Lamasara’s religious center, a pantheistic temple of several deities. 
Starting Reputation Points 12 
**Revered** 
Abstalar approaches the party with an offer to take over the duties of running the cathedral once he retires. 
**Admired** 
Spellcasting services for healing and recovery are free; prices for other spellcasting services are half off. 
**Liked** 
The prices for healing or items at the cathedral decrease to 90% of regular asking price. 
**Disliked** 
The prices for healing or items at the cathedral increase to 110% of regular asking price. 
**Hated** 
The prices for healing or items at the cathedral increase to 150% of regular asking price. 
**Hunted** 
Members of the party are not welcome in the Lamasara Cathedral, and can’t purchase healing therein. 
### Lamasara MERCANTILE LEAGUE 
A union once formed by the town’s founding families, but now represented by providers and shopkeepers. Starting Reputation Points 0 
**Revered** 
The Mercantile League shares up-to-date hints, advice, and opportunities with the party. The maximum task level for any legal Earn Income opportunity in Lamasara increases by 2. 
**Admired**. 
Word of the PCs’ high standing in the Mercantile League damages their reputation with the LINGERING NOTE; once a month, reduce their faction points with that faction by 1d4. 
**Hated** 
Prices for any service provided by members of the Mercantile League are doubled for the party. 
**Hunted** 
The Mercantile League loathes the PCs so much that their members spend a significant amount of time spreading rumors, pressuring others to cut ties, and otherwise hindering the party’s reputation. Each month, the PCs lose 1d6 Reputation Points, reduced from factions other than the Lamasara Mercantile League as they wish. 
### LINGERING NOTE 
A conglomeration of industrial companies and concerns owned by one of Lamasara’s richest (and most unpleasant) aristocrats. Starting Reputation Points –8 
**Revered** 
Titus Scarnetti himself invites the PCs to a grand feast at his manor. Feel free to roleplay this event out, but at the end of the feast, he presents each PC with a one-time gift of a permanent magic item of a level equal to that PC’s level. 
**Admired** 
Word of the PCs’ high standing in the Consortium damages their reputation with the Lamasara Mercantile League; once a month, reduce their faction points with that faction by 1d4. 
**Disliked** 
Consortium agents take extra time spreading slanderous rumors about the PCs in town. This causes the PCs to suffer a –1 circumstance penalty on all attempts to Gather Information, unless they’re doing so with a member of a faction that they are at least **Liked** by. 
**Hated** 
As **Disliked**, but a –2 circumstance penalty. 
**Hunted** 
Titus Scarnetti hires a group of assassins to murder the party. This should be built as a Severe encounter; the timing of the attack is left to the GM. If the assassins are defeated, Titus hires another group every 1d4 months as long as he remains active and free to act. 
### TOWN WATCH 
Lamasara’s town guards are keepers of the peace and protectors of the citizenry. 
Starting Reputation Points 0 
**Revered** 
The Town Watch officially deputizes the PCs, granting them the right to issue arrests in Lamasara’s name, and allowing them free use of the Lamasara Garrison’s lodgings, training facilities, and workshops. 
**Admired** 
The Town Watch makes it clear to all in Lamasara that the PCs are trustworthy. As long as the PCs remain at this tier or better, they do not suffer the **Disliked** or **Hated** effects of the LINGERING NOTE. 
**Hated** 
The Town Watch makes life difficult for the PCs. Attempts to Earn Income, Gather Information, or Subsist in town take a –2 circumstance penalty. **Hunted** 
A warrant for the party’s arrest is issued the next time they set foot in town, but since the PCs are formidable, the Town Watch enjoins the aid of a small group of Hellknights from the Order of the Nail from Magnimar to make the arrest—and if the PCs are captured, they are immediately carted off to Magnimar to face prison sentences. The encounter with the Hellknights should be a Moderate one. If the PCs defeat that, the next one is a Severe one. If the PCs manage to defeat the Severe encounter, the Hellknights refuse to try again, and instead the PCs face periodic Severe encounters with lawful or good groups of adventurers eager to “save Lamasara from their villains.”
### TOWNSFOLK 
The citizens of Lamasara, watched over by mayor Kendra Deverin. 
Starting Reputation Points 0 
**Revered** 
The townsfolk commission a statue of the PCs to be erected in the town square, placing their images alongside those of the heroes who defeated Runelord Karzoug. This public display raises their standing in town—the PCs gain 2 Reputation Points with all other factions. 
**Admired** 
The PCs are praised while in town, with citizens giving them small gifts, flirting, or simply admiring them from afar. Once a month, each PC can attempt a DC 18 flat check; on a success, a resident gives them a minor gift of your choosing worth up to 12 gp. 
**Hated** 
The townsfolk hurl insults—or worse—at the PCs whenever they’re in town. The constant deluge of hateful words or thrown garbage wears at the PCs, and while out in public in town they take a –1 circumstance penalty to all Wisdom-based skill checks. 
**Hunted** 
A mob of angry townsfolk rise up against the party the next time they visit town. Treat this as an encounter with a city guard squadron (Pathfinder Bestiary 3 47), but without the Fire Crossbows! action, and change the Lower Halberds! action to Pitchforks and Torches (change the damage type to piercing or fire).

## Side Quests 
#### RESEARCHING THE PIT
The Pit has long been known to the locals as a place of danger. Simply asking around to Gather Information is an excellent way to learn more about the site; each attempt to do so takes 2 hours of work. Alternatively, a PC can attempt to Recall Information about the Pit on their own. Finally, Brodert Quink’s collection of lore likely holds additional secrets; these checks take 1 hour. 
##### THE PIT RESEARCH TOPIC 4 
UNIQUE LINGUISTIC 
**Gathering Information** Many locals have their own stories and tall tales about the Pit; **Maximum RP** 5 
**Research Checks** *DC 19 Diplomacy* 
**Recall Knowledge** Any PC with the right skills can attempt to remember information about the Pit; **Maximum RP** 5 
**Research Checks** *DC 17 Lamasara Lore, DC 19 Society* 
**Consulting Brodert Quink** Brodert has a large collection of old books and tomes that contain bits and pieces of information about the Pit, but unless the PCs earn his support (page 174), every time they attempt a Research check here, he’ll charge them 5 sp for his services; **Maximum RP** 5 
**Research Checks** *DC 19 Academia Lore or Library Lore, DC 21 Perception* 
	**1 Research Point** The Pit is a mysterious open shaft in the heart of the rocky escarpment known as Devil’s Platter; it’s located just over 2 miles to the southeast of Lamasara. 
	**4 Research Points** The safest route to the Pit is to take the Lost Coast Road south to Cougar Creek Road. Then, follow the road southeast past Trennel’s Farm and Sarl’s Farm, and turn east along Wisher’s Trail. Upon reaching Wisher’s Well, head north; the rise up to Devil’s Platter is rough but climbable there. The Pit itself is about a half-mile north of the climb. Locals mention that Brodert Quink likely knows more about the Pit, and if he doesn’t, there’s surely more information among his collection of old books. 
	**6 Research Points** The Pit is about 50 feet across, and who knows how deep it is since it’s always filled with fog at about 50 feet down. A few ledges lead down the inner shaft to some caves. Sources say that the Lamasara Devil lives at the bottom of the Pit. Adventurers used to visit the Pit semi-regularly, but the place is dangerous, and these days most opt instead to seek adventure elsewhere. The latest group of adventurers to attempt to explore the Pit included Alma Avertin’s daughter, Arika, but Arika claims they ran afoul of the Lamasara Devil. She was the only survivor. 
	**10 Research Points** There are several caves lining the Pit’s inner walls. A clan of goblins dwells in the uppermost caverns. They’re known as the Whistlefangs for their practice of drilling holes in their teeth to help them whistle loudly; it’s said they communicate this way. Adventurers have explored the Pit’s caves before, but the place is dangerous and very few come back. A while back, a group of adventurers plumbed the Pit with a rope and weight and got a measurement of 150 feet, but when they tried a second measurement from the opposite side, something grabbed the rope and pulled all but one of them down to their deaths. The surviving adventurer left the area and never returned. 
	**15 Research Points** Reports from other adventurers claim that some of the caves in the Pit’s walls aren’t caves at all, but ancient Thuviaian ruins. Most believe this to be just rumors spread by doubtful adventurers who weren’t even brave enough to enter the Pit in the first place and are looking for attention. 
**Reward**: Grant the PCs 10 XP for each tier of Research Points they reach, to a maximum of 50 XP if they reach 15 Research Points

#### LOOKING FOR ARIKA AVERTIN
Once the PCs learn about Arika Avertin’s tragic adventure in the Pit, they may try to seek her out for more information. With a successful *DC 15 Diplomacy check* to Gather Information, a PC confirms that she still lives in town, but she’s been away for a while with a new group of adventurers. A visit to Lamasara Savories (area 21 on Lamasara’s map) confirms that she’s not in town. Her mother, Alma, is worried about her, and if she trusts the PCs she might ask them to keep an eye out for her. Alma can confirm who Arika’s been adventuring with (see Dinner at the Rusty Dragon on page 35) but isn’t sure where she is now—last she heard, Arika and her new group had headed south to Magnimar. Alma’s had arguments with her daughter about her adventuring lifestyle, and worries that their last fight may have driven a rift between them that might not mend—if the PCs find her, she asks them to let her know that “Mother is worried about you and wants you to come home.
The PCs might also ask the Runewatchers, for this faction is known to keep track of local adventuring groups. The Runewatchers, a relatively new group in town of scholars who study all things Thuviaian, can confirm that Arika’s previous adventuring group met a grisly end in the Pit, but other than knowing that she recently headed to Magnimar to join a new adventuring group, they don’t have much more information about her whereabouts at this time. If the Runewatchers learn that the PCs are intending on investigating the Pit, they become very interested—see the start of Chapter 3 for details.

#### The Clockwork Songbird 
Vorvashali Voon runs the Feathered Serpent, Lamasara’s only curio shop, and as such, he makes it a point to get to know adventurers—after all, their discoveries keep his shelves stocked! The first time the PCs return from the Pit and are at least **5th** level, they find a message from Vorvashali waiting for them, inviting them to pay him a visit at his shop and offering a 5% discount on that visit. 
When the PCs visit, they find Vorvashali has prepared for their arrival with a delicious tray of baked goods and candies from Lamasara Savories. He closes the shop as they enter and invites them to have a seat at the least-cluttered table in the shop, and as he feeds them baked goods, he asks them to recount their latest adventures in the Pit. 
At some point during the conversation, he produces a curious object—what appears to be the wingless, headless, legless body of a clockwork bird about the size of a blue jay. Vorvashali tells the PCs that an adventurer claimed to have found the part in a goblin’s den on Devil’s Platter, and he’s eager to find more parts of the bird if they’re out there. He asks the PCs to keep an eye out for parts that might fit this bird (he suspects there are five more parts—a pair of wings, the head, the tail, the feet, and the winding mechanism), and says that he’ll pay 50 gp for each songbird part they find and bring him. 
Unknown to Vorvashali, when completed, this clockwork songbird’s song can be used to open a vault door deep in the Pit (see area H13). He won’t part with the component he has now for any price, but he may eventually entrust it to the PCs if they can gain his support (see page 171), or once they prove themselves to be Lamasara’s newest heroes.

## Living in Lamasara
Whether or not the PCs are locals or visiting Lamasara from elsewhere, for the duration of this adventure it’s assumed they’ll be living in Lamasara. The Seven Dooms for Lamasara Player’s Guide provides information and advice for the players in determining where in town their characters live—if you’re not using this document in your game, you’ll want to determine where the PCs are staying early in the campaign. Homeless PCs can always attempt to *Subsist* in the alleys (with a DC 13 Society check), by hiding in a hazardous location (with a DC 15 Stealth check), or in the immediate hinterlands (with a DC 17 Survival check). 
### EARNING INCOME 
While it’s expected that the PCs’ primary source of income is adventuring, there’s plenty of opportunity to augment wallets and coffers during downtime via Earning Income. Any PC can attempt to Earn Income in Lamasara with a Crafting, Lore, or Performance check, but the maximum task level that can normally be attempted in town is equal to that of Lamasara’s level: 4. A shady PC can attempt to Earn Income through petty crime such as pickpocketing, running con games, or even minor burglaries, but without support, a freelance criminal in Lamasara runs a greater risk of punishment. As with other methods of earning income, unsupported Thievery in town is limited to a maximum task level of 4. If a PC fails at an attempt to Earn Income with Thievery, they can abandon any payment they would have earned from the failure to escape repercussions, otherwise they’re caught in the act; a critical failure guarantees being caught. Each time a PC is caught during freelance Thievery, the party loses 1d4 Reputation Points from every faction. For minor crimes, the PC is expected to return all stolen property and pay a fine to the town equal to twice the value of the property they stole or face a number of days in jail in the garrison (area 10). An agent of the The Other Hand is likely to approach a captured PC to offer them a chance at freedom if they join the club— see Earning Reputation below. Earning the support of an NPC who lives at an employer location (see Earning Support below) often allows a PC to use other skills to Earn Income or unlocks higher task levels to pursue. 
### EARNING SUPPORT 
If a PC adjusts an NPC’s attitude condition to Helpful (which might require completion of a task, but usually just requires successful Diplomacy checks to Make an Impression), that NPC’s location supports the party in certain exploration and downtime activities. The specific benefits are based on the location’s traits and are listed below. This support generally lasts throughout the campaign, although sometimes events in play can automatically adjust support—some examples are noted in the individual adventures, but other events in the game should have ramifications as well. There’s no limit to the number of locations that can support the party; once the PCs gain the support of a location, they retain it until significant events say otherwise. 
Some locations allow certain types of characters to *retrain more efficiently* once they’ve made that location’s NPC Helpful. In such a location, retraining that would normally require a week takes only 5 days, retraining that would normally require a month takes only 3 weeks, and the retraining itself is generally free. Every location’s first tag indicates what faction it belongs to. The first time anyone in the party earns the support of a location, the party increases their Reputation Points with that faction by 1, unless they are already **Admired** or **Hated**, in which case no Reputation Points are earned. 
**Criminal**: Characters who focus on criminal activities can retrain efficiently at this location. A character who uses Underworld Lore to Earn Income gains a +1 circumstance bonus on the check. A character can use Thievery to Earn Income (the task level is equal to or less than the NPC’s level), but a critical failure on this check may result in legal action or possible imprisonment. 
**Employer**: The location offers tasks up to its level for PCs to Earn Income using Crafting (to craft items associated with the location) or any of the skills mentioned in the entry once it supports the PCs. 
**Garrison**: Martially inclined characters can retrain efficiently here. On-site Gather Information or Treat Wounds checks gain a +1 circumstance bonus. 
**Hazard**: The site has little to offer other than potential dangers of the GM’s design. Hazards can serve as places to hide out, as they are not often visited by locals. A PC can attempt to Subsist at a Hazard site with a DC 15 Stealth check. 
**Housing**: The location offers supported PCs a 10% discount for accommodations (in the case of a commercial operation) or a comfortable cost of living at no charge (in the case of a poorhouse). 
**Library**: Scholarly characters, as well as arcane and occult spellcasters, can retrain efficiently at a library. On-site Create Forgery, Decipher Writing, Research, or Learn a Spell checks gain a +1 item bonus. 
**Lodge**: Primal spellcasters can retrain efficiently here. On-site Identify Magic or Subsist checks gain a +1 circumstance bonus. 
**Merchant**: A PC can sell goods for 55% of their value, instead of half, to a Helpful NPC merchant, and all items for sale and services provided at this location are discounted by 5%. 
**Municipal**: If a PC secures the friendship of a Helpful NPC at a municipal site, they’ve earned the support of one of Lamasara’s leaders. A PC can call in a favor with a Helpful NPC at such a site in order to help with all sorts of other problems, such as avoiding a jail sentence or fine, securing access to a restricted location, or learning a closely guarded secret. The exact nature and magnitude of the favor is determined by the GM, but once the favor is granted, that NPC cannot be called upon for another favor for a period of time—typically one year, but this duration can shift to match the scope of the favor. 
**Parlor**: Socially inclined and skill-focused PCs can retrain more efficiently here. On-site Gather Information or Performance checks to Earn Income gain a +1 circumstance bonus. 
**Residence**: Earning the support of an NPC at a residence grants the PCs a specific benefit associated with that NPC, as detailed in the individual location stat block. 
**Restaurant**: The allied NPC helps to keep the PC fed, granting a +1 circumstance bonus on Society checks made to Subsist. The PC also becomes a well-known regular of the restaurant, and gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Gather Information attempts made at the establishment. 
**Temple**: Faithful PCs whose beliefs align with those of the temple can use a temple to retrain efficiently. Checks to Identify Magic, Treat Wounds, or Treat Disease on-site gain a +1 circumstance bonus. 
**Venue**: Bards and characters who thrive on public performances can use venues to retrain efficiently, and attempts to Earn Income with Performance checks gain a +1 circumstance bonus. 
**Workshop**: A supported PC may utilize the location’s workshop and resources to Craft items associated with the location’s purpose, and gains a +1 item bonus on all associated Crafting checks. 
## Exploring the Town 
Each location is presented as a stat block that summarizes the site’s name, general function, and level (for the purpose of determining any necessary values associated with it, such as the highest-level task available to Earn Income). This stat block also notes the site’s address, gives a brief description of the location, wares and services for sale there, and information about the most significant NPC who lives or works at the establishment. The NPC’s initial attitude condition to the PCs is also listed, along with DCs most likely to be useful when interacting with that NPC. 
#### Location 1. Lamasara CATHEDRAL LOCATION 5
Lamasara CATHEDRAL LODGE MERCHANT MUNICIPAL TEMPLE

Abstalar typically has the following divine spells available: 3rd heal (×4), remove disease; 2nd heal, restoration, restore senses; 1st heal (×3); Cantrips (3rd) detect magic, guidance, light, message, prestidigitation. Other spells are available if arrangements can be made at least a day in advance. 
**Abstalar Zantus**, **high priest** (CG male human cleric of Desna 7; friendly; Perception DC 23, Will DC 23) If the PCs earn the support of the Lamasara Cathedral, Abstalar allows them to use several guest rooms in the northern portion of the complex for a base of operations. In addition, the PCs earn 3 Reputation Points with the Lamasara Cathedral.
#### Location 2. Lamasara BONEYARD LOCATION 3

*A large graveyard that includes stone vaults for affluent families along with dozens of more humble burial plots.*

Other spells are available if arrangements can be made at least a day in advance. 
**Naffer Vosk, gravedigger** (NG male human cleric of Sarenrae 3; indifferent; Perception DC 19, Will DC 21). If Naffer supports the PCs, he trusts them enough to offer employment as assistant caretakers. This allows the PCs to Earn Income using Religion. 
#### Location 3. THE WHITE DEER LOCATION 4 
Lamasara MERCANTILE LEAGUE EMPLOYER HOUSING RESTAURANT 
**Address** 150 Church Street 
*A recently rebuilt tavern and inn with clean and spacious rooms to rent.*
