# Effect: Ghostcaller's Planchette - Armor (Greater)
## Level 18
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Ghostcaller's Planchette (Greater)|Ghostcaller's Planchette (Greater)]]

After you cast a necromancy spell by activating the _planchette_, you gain resistance 10 to all physical damage (except _ghost touch_) until the start of your next turn. Attacks by incorporeal creatures (such as a ghostâ€™s ghostly hand) count as _ghost touch_.
