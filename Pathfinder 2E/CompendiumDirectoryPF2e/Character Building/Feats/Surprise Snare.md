# Surprise Snare `pf2:3`
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]][[manipulate]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Snarecrafter Dedication
* * *
You install one of your snares prepared for quick deployment in a space that's occupied by an opponent. It must be a snare that normally takes 1 minute or less to [[Actions/Craft|Craft]].

The snare automatically triggers, but it takes a -2 circumstance penalty to any applicable save DC, as well as any attack rolls or other checks the snare attempts.
