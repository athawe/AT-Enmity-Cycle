**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** member of the Lion Blades; trained in Performance

Your lion blade spy training helps you conceal yourself and your identity. You become trained in your choice of Deception or Stealth and in Espionage Lore; if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You never take circumstance penalties for attempting to take a disguise of a different ancestry, age, and so on, as long as the disguised form is appropriate for your size.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Lion Blade|Lion Blade]] archetype.
