### Background

**Quote:** “You should take a load off, mate. And have a drink. It won’t bring him back, but it’ll keep us all sane.”
**Roleplaying:**
- A loud and hearty laugh that comes easily.
- Somehow finds a way to use elaborate metaphors featuring Andoran ales regardless of the actual topic of conversation.
- Likes to slap people on the back. (If it stings, you know he likes you. If it is hard enough to make you lose your balance, you know he does not.)
**Background:** Horgron is from Andoran. When he was just a young kid, his father went off to fight in a bloody frontier conflict in the River Kingdoms. He never came back. Horgron moved to Thuvia with his late mother. He made a pledge that he would work to never see his new home torn apart by such senseless violence. He became a politician and quickly discovered how difficult the dream of peace can be.
