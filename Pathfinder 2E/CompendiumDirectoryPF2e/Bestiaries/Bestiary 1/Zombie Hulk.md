A thrown shambler lands [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]], but if it's not destroyed, it can rise and use other actions normally."

These towering horrors are animated from the corpses of monstrosities.

A zombie's only desire is to consume the living. Unthinking and ever-shambling harbingers of death, zombies stop only when they're destroyed.
