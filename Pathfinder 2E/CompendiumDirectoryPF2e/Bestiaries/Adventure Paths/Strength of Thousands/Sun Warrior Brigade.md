    desc: "  Whenever the troop Strides, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then move up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the troop enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole troop."

  - name: "Troop Spellcasting"
    desc: "  When the sun warrior brigade Casts a Spell, its constituent members combine their efforts into casting a more powerful version of the spell than any one member could achieve alone. When Casting a Spell that has an area of a burst, cone, or line and doesn't have a duration, increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a smaller radius is not affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line."

  - name: "Walkena's Radiance"
    desc: "`pf2:2` (divine,fire,light) The brigade calls upon Walkena to burn and blind their foes. The sun warriors present their religious symbols and create a white-hot flash of light in a 45-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 10d8 fire damage (DC 29 Fortitude check save). Creatures that fail their save become [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]] for 1 round. Creatures that critically fail become [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for 1 round instead. When the troop is reduced to 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 20-foot cone."
