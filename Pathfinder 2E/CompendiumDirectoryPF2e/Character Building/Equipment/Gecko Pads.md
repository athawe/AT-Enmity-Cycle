Gecko pads are thin, clockwork devices shaped like palms, which can be strapped onto existing handwear or a creature's hands. When activated, they whir to life and improve your grip on surfaces, while slowly releasing a sticky substance stored within the device's surface to help you [[Actions/Climb|Climb]]. The pads give you a climb Speed equal to your Speed for 10 minutes as long as your hands are free.
