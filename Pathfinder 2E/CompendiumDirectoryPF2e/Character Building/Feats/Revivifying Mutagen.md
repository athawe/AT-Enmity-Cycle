# Revivifying Mutagen `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




While under the effect of a mutagen, you can metabolize that mutagen's power to heal yourself.

This uses a single action, which has the concentrate and manipulate traits.

Once the action is complete, you regain 1d6 Hit Points for every 2 item levels of the mutagen (minimum 1d6), but the mutagen's duration immediately ends, even if you are under the effect of Persistent Mutagen.
