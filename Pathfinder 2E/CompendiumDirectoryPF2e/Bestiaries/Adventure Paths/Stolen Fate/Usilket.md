    desc: " (healing) **Frequency** once per day\n* * *\n\n**Effect** One of Usilket's most unusual abilities is a technique they learned during a long visit to Jalmeray. Usilket enters a trancelike state for 10 minutes, during which they can attempt to remove a disease or one of the following conditions: [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy]], [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied]]. To remove the disease or condition, Usilket must counteract the disease or condition with a Medicine check. Usilket can attempt to counteract a disease or condition present in another creature, as long as that creature remains adjacent to the witchwyrd during the entire meditation."
