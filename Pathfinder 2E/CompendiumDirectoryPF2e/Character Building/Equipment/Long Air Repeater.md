Like the one-handed air repeater, this thin-barreled firearm uses a container of pressurized air instead of black powder to propel small metal pellets from an attached cartridge. The long air repeater has better range and ammo capacity than the one-handed variant, though it still lacks significant stopping power. A typical long air repeater magazine holds 8 pellets.
