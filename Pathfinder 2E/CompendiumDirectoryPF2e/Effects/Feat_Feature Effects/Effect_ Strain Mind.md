# Effect: Strain Mind
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Strain Mind|Strain Mind]]

You add an amp that costs 1 Focus Point to the spell. Instead of paying the normal Focus Point cost, you lose Hit Points equal to four times the spell rank of the amped psi cantrip as you bleed from your nose or suffer some other visible sign of strain.
