Caligni stalkers are often leaders of caligni enclaves.

* * *

Calignis lurk in subterranean cities, creeping to the surface to steal, stalk, or make mischief. Each caligni serves in a specific role and grows into a specific form as determined by supernatural traditions and influences in caligni society. Regardless of their size or role, all calignis are gaunt, with pale flesh and white eyes. Some surface dwellers call the caligni "dark folk," a term they dislike because it doesn't reflect either their appearance or character, only their environment.
