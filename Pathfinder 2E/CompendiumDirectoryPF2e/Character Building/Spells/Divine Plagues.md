    desc: "Your deity sends wracking plagues. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. When you Cast the Spell, decide whether the disease inflicts the Clumsy, Enfeebled, or Stupefied condition.\n\n**Divine Plague** (disease) **Level** 1\n\n**Stage 1** [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 1]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]], or [[Conditions/Stupefied 1|Stupefied 1]] (1 round)\n\n**Stage 2** [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]], and Clumsy 1, Enfeebled 1, or Stupefied 1 (1 round)\n\n**Stage 3** Clumsy 1, Enfeebled 1, or Stupefied 1 and the target can't recover from the condition until they are cured (1 day)\n* * *\n\n**Success** The target is unaffected.\n\n**Failure** The target is afflicted with divine plague at stage 1.\n\n**Critical Failure** The target is afflicted with divine plague at stage 2.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (5th)** The divine plague disease gains the virulent trait.
