    desc: "`pf2:1` (poison) **Requirements** The krooth damaged a creature with its jaws Strike on its most recent action this turn\n* * *\n\n**Effect** The krooth snaps off one of its teeth in the creature it hit. The creature takes 1d6 bleed and is [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 1]]. Neither the persistent bleed damage nor the drained condition can be healed while the tooth remains. Removing the tooth safely requires a successful DC 24 Medicine check check to Administer First Aid. Instead of ending bleeding or stabilizing, this removes the drained condition, but it doesn't automatically end the bleed damage."
