## Locating the Riverboat
At this point, there aren’t many obvious leads for the PCs to follow, so they’ll likely need to begin asking around the Lamasara arts community about strange happenings or any enemies Valls and Dhia might have had. Much of what they hear is gossip, having to do with petty squabbles between the many strong personalities in the city. However, the PCs can find a few clues that lead to the riverboat, while some provide foreshadowing of the work at the Riversong Theater, although that name is never mentioned. A character who succeeds at a *DC 20 Diplomacy check* to *Gather Information* hears one of the following rumors after 2 hours; if they get a critical success, they hear two rumors. 
- “Strange? Sure, it’s strange that I haven’t gotten a part yet. I was the star of the show back at the theater in Magnimar a few years ago. I don’t understand why no one here seems to care about that!” 
- “Some of the people who act as patrons in this town don’t really care about art at all. They just want the prestige of finding the next big star. I suppose I can’t blame them. I’d be happy with a patron who cared about either, honestly.” 
- “I was talking to someone on the street the other day, you know, just chatting, and she told me about this creepy meeting she had a month ago. This Osiriani woman was offering to hire her to do some set design, but she had this bodyguard who just stared at her the whole time. Something about him seemed off, and when this woman said to meet her at one of the riverboats, she decided to not even show up. I wish I knew the names, but I just don’t.” 
- “I have a friend I haven’t seen in a while. He told me he’d been hired to do some costuming for this big project that was very secretive. I thought it was a little rude that he didn’t check if I was interested. Now I’m stuck working at my family’s stall in the market while he’s off doing high-paid work at some riverboat!” 
- “Now that you mention it, yes, I did see something suspicious. There was someone skulking around the riverboats the other night. I mean, I’m sure there are plenty of people who don’t want to be seen there, but this one was hanging around one of the boats that had a closed sign. Seemed odd. I think the place was called Fickle Wind.” 
- “My sister hasn’t been home in two weeks, and I’m getting concerned. She said she got an offer from a patron in town for a secret project. She told me she was supposed to meet with this woman at one of the riverboats. I wish I’d asked which one!” 
- “With the city this busy, you’d think everyone down in the riverboat district would be preparing, but one of my favorite boats, the Fickle Wind, suddenly closed the other week. Maybe they’re renovating or something. Anyway, the person at the dock was a bit rude when I tried to get aboard.” 
- “I was supposed to have some work done on my house, but the entire crew got hired right out from under me even though I’d already signed a contract! When I went to talk to their boss, she said if I knew where to find them, I should tell her. Apparently they all just walked off and took some other job without even telling her.” 
- “If you’re looking for suspicious people, you’ll find plenty of them where the riverboats are moored. I know there are legitimate businesses down there, but I also know there’s a reason many of the boats want to be able to move their entire operation at a moment’s notice.” 
### CULTIST AMBUSH MODERATE 5 
Depending on how well the PCs have kept their actions unnoticed, the Usij cultists headquartered at the *Fickle Wind* might send a group of assassins after the PCs to stop their investigation. If the PCs haven’t yet learned the location of the riverboat, this encounter can also provide a way to gain more information by interrogating one of the cultists or following one who tries to escape. If this encounter doesn’t occur before the PCs make it to the riverboat, it should take place shortly after they’ve finished there but before they leave for the composer’s house. If any creatures escaped the PCs before the encounter takes place, you can increase the difficulty by adding them to this encounter. 
**Creatures**: The cultists are accompanied by a sand wolf. Given the creature’s size, it spends much of its time hidden or burrowing. The cultists do their best to attack the PCs when the party is unprepared or away from bystanders. A tight alley or even the PCs’
place of lodging are all perfect spots for the assassins to launch their attack. The assailants are ready to survive another day if necessary, fleeing to the Fickle Wind if the other cultist falls in combat. The sand wolf remains to fight to the death.

## The Riverboat 
The Junira River has made Lamasara’s location desirable and sustainable. Because it doesn’t have a flood cycle like some other rivers in the region, such as the Sphinx, the land surrounding it remains infertile desert for the most part. Industrious farmers divert the river in places near Lamasara, providing for some local crops, but such efforts are difficult and limited in scope. What the river is good for, however, is travel and trade. With a relatively slow flow, broad width, and deep bottom, many boats can move up and down its length with ease. 
Lamasara is particularly known for the large number of roomy, flat-bottomed pleasure barges that ply the Junira. Some are simply refitted boats that once hauled cargo or passengers, while others are purpose- built to serve the growing desire for gambling and other forms of entertainment. While most of these pleasure barges are reputable places to dine, carouse, and play games of chance, the ability to quickly pick up their business and move elsewhere also makes them a popular choice for thieves’ guilds and other organizations who wish to operate outside local laws. Law enforcement in Lamasara has mostly given up on trying to apprehend such businesses and grudgingly ignore them. Roughly 30 of these barges are moored in Lamasara’s docks at any time, though more crowd the waters during festivals or the year when the sun orchid auction takes place in the city. 
The clues the PCs find should lead them to the riverboat district and possibly even the Fickle Wind, a former cargo vessel that has been beautified and repurposed as a gambling hall. Its owner, **Hamari** (N male elf captain), spent years with the ship going up and down the Junira. He decided to spend his savings to refurbish it only a few months ago and Usij Cultist 30 met with moderate success until recently when Zridi targeted his establishment. Unable to resist the idea of ruining someone’s life’s work and dreams, she first befriended **Hamari**, then led him to make a series of unnecessary, overpriced improvements on the ship he simply couldn’t afford. She then offered to loan the captain some money to cover his other debts, and soon she effectively reaped all of the positive benefits of the business. 
Zridi took full advantage of this situation about a month ago when she sent Seddek, along with some Usij cultists and scrapborn, to take control of the ship completely. Seddek made it clear he was there on Zridi’s behalf, and when the captain put up a struggle, the janni knocked him unconscious and imprisoned him. After taking control of the ship, the janni and his minions converted most of the space into a prison for the artists they’d abducted in Lamasara to work on The Enmity Cycle. 
Seddek doesn’t spend much time on the Fickle Wind anymore; instead, he remains at the composer’s house, where he can keep an eye on the Chimera members and make sure they follow the directions Zridi sends them. The cultists left in charge now only oversee a few prisoners who have almost outlived their usefulness to Zridi and her work. 
When the PCs arrive at the ship, read or paraphrase the following. 
==Moored by several sturdy ropes is a rather large, ornate dhow. It lacks sails, although most of the rigging is in place. The ship has been painted a garish green, and gaudy gold leaf highlights the many geometric carvings along the upper hull from bow to stern. Colorful flags wave in the light breeze coming off the river, and a series of green and blue lanterns hang from the rigging. A sign that reads “closed” is strung across the gangplank.== 
The ship has been completely overtaken by Seddek and his gang of thugs at the command of Zridi. For the last week, it has been closed for business, with only a few of the Usij occupants coming and going from the Fickle Wind to bring back food and other supplies. The scrapborn who occupy the ship generally stay out of sight. The map for this location is on this page.  
### D1. MAIN DECK MODERATE 5 
==Two masts rise from the main deck of the ship, the foremost one leaning slightly toward the bow. A few tables and chairs have been arranged in neat rows. Two closed hatches are between the masts, while a stairway near the bow leads below deck. Toward the stern is a single door leading to an enclosed area below the quarterdeck, and stairs on either side lead to the quarterdeck itself.==
The main deck has been left largely alone by the new residents. They know that making any major changes will draw more attention to the ship than a simple closed sign. If anyone tries to come up the gangplank during the day, the scrapborn alert one of the Usij cultists by tapping on the riverboat’s hull, and the cultist comes up to shoo the visitor away. 
**Creatures**: The scrapborn typically remain out of sight during the day. They keep a close watch on anyone approaching the ship and have been told to not allow anyone on board without Seddek’s permission. The creatures are more aggressive at night. If someone forces their way onto the deck, they move to attack, throwing any unconscious or dead victims into the water. If reduced to fewer than *20 Hit Points*, they attempt to flee by jumping overboard into the water and swimming away.

**HP** 81; **Weaknesses** electricity 5; **Resistances** acid 5
**Sacrifice Armor** `pf2:r` **Trigger** The scrapborn is damaged by an attack dealing physical damage
**Effect** The scrapborn directs the damage to one of the pieces of scrap attached to its body and gains resistance 15 against the triggering attack, but its AC is lowered by 2 for 24 hours. The scrapborn's AC cannot be reduced below 16 in this way.
**Speed** 25 feet, swim 30 feet

**Ranged** `pf2:1` Thrown Scrap +13 **Damage** 2d8 + 2 bludgeoning
**Rebuild Armor** `pf2:1` **Requirements** The scrapborn's previous action was a successful claw Strike against a target wearing armor and that armor is not broken
**Effect** The scrapborn pulls and rips at the target's armor. The target must attempt a *DC 20 Reflex check save.*
	**Critical Success** The target is unaffected. 
	**Success** The target's armor takes 1d8 piercing damage, ignoring the armor's Hardness. 
	**Failure** The target's armor takes 2d8 piercing damage, which ignores the armor's Hardness; if this causes the armor to become broken, the scrapborn can incorporate the removed armor piece into its own body and raise its AC by 1 (to a maximum of 22). 
	**Critical Failure** As failure, except instead of damage, the target's armor is automatically reduced to its BT and the scrapborn increases its AC by 2.
### D2. STOREROOM 
==Gambling tables, numerous chairs, and other assorted furniture have been crammed into this room, filling it from floor to ceiling.== 
After taking over the ship, Krashk ordered the Usij to make room for prisoners in the lower decks. Rather than gather too much attention by simply dumping the contents overboard, they were shoved into here. 
**Treasure**: Mixed in with the junk is a small lockbox (*DC 20 Thievery to unlock*) that contains 64 gp. 
### D3. PRIVATE GAMBLING ROOM 
==A round, low table occupies the center of this room with several cushions arranged about as seating. The walls have been polished to a dark brown, and an oil painting of a sunrise over a rocky desert scene hangs from the wall to the south.== 
After converting the Fickle Wind from a shipping vessel to a gambling parlor, Hamari made this room one of the first gambling dens on the ship. He’d planned to make more improvements to it based on Zridi’s suggestion that he remodel and redecorate, but his money ran out before he had a chance. When not on duty, some of the Usij cultists use this room for recreation. 
**Treasure**: A character who *Searches* and succeeds at a *DC 19 Perception check* locates a secret wall safe, of Duwwori manufacture, behind the painting. The safe contains 70 gp and is locked, requiring a character to succeed at two *DC 20 Thievery* checks to open. Zridi and Seddek both know the combination. 
### D4. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS MODERATE 5 
==Windows line all the walls except those to the north in this nearly bare room. A simple bed rests in a corner next to a leather-bound chest and a small table. The wooden floor is splintered and cracked, and the white paint on the walls is chipped and smudged.==
As Zridi’s influence took hold of Hamari, he began to pour more and more of his savings into the upgrades on the ship. He didn’t spend anything to upgrade his own quarters, and the disrepair here is a direct result. When Zridi handed over control of the ship to Seddek, she told the janni to leave the captain alive so he could suffer watching all he’d built be taken away by the scrapborn, who tore into the captain’s possessions to tack onto their own bodies. 
**Creatures**: Hamari spends most of his day in this room with the two scrapborn guarding him. The creatures don’t spend much time keeping watch out of the windows, nor do they really care about what the captain does as long as he remains inside. They attack any intruders on sight and fight to the death, certain that Zridi’s punishment for fleeing would be a worse fate. The captain tries to stay out of the way. If it becomes necessary, use statistics for a bosun on page 243 of Gamemastery Guide.

	**Critical Failure** As failure, except instead of damage, the target's armor is automatically reduced to its BT and the scrapborn increases its AC by 2.

**Speaking With the Captain**: If he survives the encounter, Hamari can provide the PCs with quite a bit of information. He knows the layout of the ship precisely and even has a rough sense of where all the creatures are located; he can provide a simple map within a few minutes’ time. He’s unaware of the ceustodaemon in area D6, although he has heard something large moving below deck on occasion. Hamari also knows that there were prisoners brought aboard a few days ago, but he doesn’t know if they’re still here. 
If asked about who imprisoned him, he shares a brief version of his history as a riverboat captain, his meeting with the charming Zridi, and his attempt to build a gambling business. He doesn’t know or suspect Zridi is anything other than a lovely woman who helped him see new potential. In fact, he’s quite concerned that she might be in danger. As far as he knows, the real villain is Seddek, who Hamari assumes is a local crime boss who has taken issue with his new business venture and came here to send a message or hold him for ransom. The captain is taken aback and gasps at any mention of the Usij, waving the idea off as if they were a made-up threat hardly likely to be wrapped up in something like this. 
### D5. STOREROOM 
Before the ship was repurposed for gambling, this room housed the second officer. Now, it’s stacked high with boxes and crates once full of food. 
### D6. GUARDIANS MODERATE 5 
==Stairs provide passage between the main deck and below. Gambling tables set up for games of chance line the walls, though most of them appear broken or in disrepair. An acrid smell fills the room.== 
**Creatures**: The ceustodaemon Kashneth has served many masters over the centuries, but he finds his duties here rather insulting. He longs for a way to subvert the orders from the janni Seddek and believes he might have a way to do so if anyone comes down here to rescue the prisoners. He was ordered by Seddek to “guard this room and kill anyone who doesn’t have my permission to be here.” This rather sloppy command does give Kashneth a loophole to exploit since he can take the word of anyone who enters that they do, in fact, have the janni’s permission. When the PCs arrive—assuming they don’t immediately attack him—the daemon speaks telepathically to them and asks, “Do you have Seddek’s permission to be here?” If anyone in the group answers in the affirmative, then he tells them he’ll let them pass, but he attacks anyone who says no. 
If questioned, the daemon explains he’s bound to serve Seddek, although he knows the janni is working for someone else. He doesn’t know the identity of this other person. He does know that there used to be another important prisoner here, a poet of some kind, but he was transferred away some time ago. The remaining prisoners (kept in area D8) are costumers and laborers, and the daemon doesn’t know anything about them. 
A bit in over his head, the cultist keeps his distance from the ceustodaemon. If fighting breaks out he tries to flank with the daemon. If the daemon refuses to fight the PCs, the cultist flees to area D8; he otherwise fights to the death. **Treasure**: The cultist carries an *iron cube*.

#### D7. SALOON MODERATE 5 
==This room is at the widest part of the ship. The walls are painted green, and their silver inlay highlights ornate carvings on all the support timbers. Broken and smashed gaming tables, ripped cushions, and other wrecked items lie in piles along the perimeter. The room stinks of unwashed bodies, and the hatch above provides little relief.== 
The kidnapped artists and laborers from Lamasara are being held in this room. The poet was kept here for a while as well, but Seddek took him away some time ago. Seven prisoners currently remain. Seddek didn’t even bother to have them restrained, for none are interested in challenging the daemon in the room toward the fore or the gnoll and her minions to the aft. 
**Creatures**: The Usij cultist directs the scrapborn. The scrapborn flee if reduced to fewer than 20 Hit Points; the cultist fights to the death.

	**Critical Failure** As failure, except instead of damage, the target's armor is automatically reduced to its BT and the scrapborn increases its AC by 2.

**Speaking With the Prisoners**: Although they’re all undernourished, the artisans are well enough to walk off the ship once the way is clear. They offer profuse thanks to the PCs and are more than happy to share what they know. Each has a similar story: they worked in the outdoor market of Lamasara doing simple drawings, reciting poetry, or dancing. Two weeks ago, they were approached by a charming woman named Zridi who flattered them and discussed a project she wanted help with. She paid each artist handsomely for their time and promised greater rewards if they would allow her to become their patron. She told them to go to the Fickle Wind where they would work in comfort and privacy. When they arrived, however, they quickly discovered the arrangement had been a lie. They were brought belowdecks and ambushed by the scrapborn and someone named Seddek. They haven’t seen Zridi since the meetings in the marketplace, but they’re certain she’s involved in their predicament. 
During the last 2 weeks, they were put to work on a new kind of production mixing various forms of art called an anbarit. They received pages of instructions as well as a direction in which they were supposed to revise the work, create costumes, or design sets. The artists can all tell that the theme of the original production had to do with peace and unity between the five city-states of Thuvia, while their revisions were supposed to emphasize distrust, suspicion, and fear. Seddek had gathered up the pages they produced just yesterday, and since then, the imprisoned artists have languished here. They overheard Seddek mention that he would be headed to “the composer’s house” next. 
If necessary, use statistics for apprentices on page 244 of Gamemastery Guide for the prisoners. 
**Treasure**: Stored in a chest in the room are the prisoners’ belongings, which they offer to the PCs as a reward for rescuing them: a suit of *+1 leather armor, a climbing bolt*, and 56 gp. 
### D8. HEADQUARTERS SEVERE 5 
==Two wooden pillars provide additional support for this spacious room. The walls are painted the same green as elsewhere in the ship, and geometric patterns inlaid in silver cover the walls. A simple bed stands in the southeast part of the room, and a table scattered with papers is next to the pillar on the east. The entire area reeks of damp fur and mechanical oil.== 
Before Seddek took it over, this room was a lounge and bar where the visitors to the riverboat could relax, have a drink, and mingle. A character who *Searches* finds the papers on the table contain a number of messages from Seddek to Krashk, the newest ones letting the gnoll know that Seddek is going to be “taking the poet to the composer’s house where we can keep an eye on all three of our precious little artists.” 
**Creatures**: Merely the leader of a small Usij cell until recently, Krashk gained a lot more influence in recent weeks after Zridi befriended her. The gnoll finds the scrapborn weird and untrustworthy and keeps her distance from them. She isn’t afraid of them, though, because she’s confident her clockwork soldier and ceustodaemon are enough to keep the strange creatures in line if the cultists can’t. 
Dhia built the clockwork soldier (which they call a mechanical assistant), but before moving the creature here, their captors forced them to modify the construct for battle and program it to obey the cultists. The clockwork is still missing its head since the PCs have the mechanical head. Krashk is still trying to prove herself and justify the latitude she has been given so far, so she fights until she’s at death’s door before trying to flee. The clockwork soldier follows its commands to eliminate intruders until destroyed.

### Repairing the Clockwork Soldier 
If most of its body is intact after the encounter, the clockwork soldier can be repaired and the mechanical head reattached to grant the mechanical head more mobility. After all, these clockwork creatures are of Dhia’s design, and the mechanical head used to rest on this very body. A character can reattach the head with a couple hours of work and a successful *DC 23 Crafting check*. Alternatively, the gnome Fingiliam happily does the job for free (and in half the time) if the PCs bring the mechanical head and body back to her shop. If the mechanical head happens to see its body and the players don’t come up with the idea to reattach the mechanical head on their own, it can recommend this course of action, perhaps very enthusiastically. 
Once the mechanical head is connected to its body, read or paraphrase the following. 
==The mechanical head twists from side to side, and its gears click softly as the head swivels in a full circle on its neck. “Oh yes!” it says. “This is quite acceptable. Much better. Much. My functionality is very nearly restored.” It pauses for a moment. “Now this is unusual. There is a connection available that was incomplete before. One moment.” With a whir of gears and sounds of metal clicking, the clockwork stands still. “Ah! Another piece of the poem. Shall I recite it?” ==
If the PCs oblige, the clockwork creature recites the following: “
==Through our diversity comes survival. 
By the might of Aspenthar, 
The ingenuity of Duwwor, 
The magic of Pashow, 
The wisdom of Merab, 
And the art of Lamasara, 
We are Thuvia!” 
The clockwork creature pauses for a moment. 
“I believe that is the final stanza of the poem I have recorded. I’m not sure how I know this, but I am certain it was to be the first section of the anbarit—what they called The Amity Cycle. It seems to introduce a theme of unity and cooperation.”== 
The now-repaired mechanical assistant is concerned about its creator’s wellbeing but isn’t quite clever enough to know what to do to ensure their safety. The construct is happy to accompany the PCs as they continue forward, even going so far as to suggest the idea if no one else does. If the PCs agree, use the mechanical assistant stat block below. It isn’t particularly creative in combat and explains that it was never designed for such things, but it follows any directions or orders the PCs give it. The mechanical assistant has the minion trait, meaning it can use 2 actions when commanded, and commanding it is a single action that has the auditory and concentrate traits. The mechanical assistant can act as it pleases but typically remains attentive and follows along. If given no commands, the mechanical assistant uses no actions except to defend itself or escape harm. As the GM, you can determine whether the mechanical assistant chooses to take a command. 
Once the PC rescue Dhia in the final chapter of this adventure, the tinkerer is elated that the mechanical assistant is mostly okay and immediately begins inspecting the odd construct and fawning over their creation. They take note of the places in which the mechanical assistant isn’t fully operational and plans to rectify that as soon as they can get back to their workshop.

**Melee** `pf2:1` retractable blade +12 (agile, finesse), Damage 2d6+7 piercing 
**Inspired Recitation** `pf2:1` The mechanical assistant recites an inspiring poem, filling allies with determination and vigor. All allies within 60 feet gain a *+1 status bonus to saving throws and 10 temporary Hit Points* for 1 minute. Once an ally has benefited from this ability, they become temporarily immune to Inspired Recitation for 10 minutes. 
**XP Award**: If the PCs repair the mechanical assistant and learn the final stanza of the poem, award them 80 XP. 

### D9. QUARTERDECK 
==This raised deck has an ornate wooden railing on all sides except where the stairs rise from the main deck. The deck is stained a dark brown, and the helm is painted a bright, garish green. Ropes with colorful lanterns connect the fore side railing to the smaller aft mast.== The scrapborn tend to avoid the quarterdeck since it would make them more visible to people on the nearby docks and other ships. 
### FOLLOWING SEDDEK’S TRAIL 
The PCs can learn that Seddek took Valls to the composer’s house by talking to the prisoners or by reading Seddek’s notes. With this information in hand, the next step is to determine which composer Seddek is talking about. Fortunately for the PCs, Valls’ fame might help them in this regard: people pay attention to where he goes and whom he speaks with. A character who spends 2 hours in the arts community and succeeds at a *DC 15 check to Gather Information* finds out that the composer they seek is Sefalia; with a critical success or a 5 gp gift, bribe, or tip, the character finds out the location of her house as well. 
The PCs can also contact city officials to find out where Sefalia lives. A character who succeeds at a *DC 20 check to Make a Request* learns the exact location; with a critical success, they learn that her house is currently under renovation. For each 5 gp the characters spend on bribes and gifts, they lower the DC of this check by 1 to a minimum DC of 10. 
Asking around about Seddek can also turn up useful information. A character who succeeds at a *DC 20 check to Gather Information* in some of the less-reputable parts of the city learns the janni is often in the company of an Osiriani woman (Zridi) who’s a relatively new patron of the arts in Lamasara. Seddek has a reputation as being somewhat thick-headed but very strong and dangerous. With a critical success, a character learns that Seddek spoke with a cloth merchant about a large order of black drapery and that the samples were delivered to a house on the outskirts of town that’s under construction. The merchant can provide exact directions to this place, which is Sefalia’s home. 
The characters can also reach out again to Tahar. After describing the information they’ve gained so far, the dwarf says the composer is likely Sefalia, whom he has sponsored in the past. Tahar knows Valls and Sefalia went to school together, and they did mention to him that they were both interested in collaborating. He doesn’t have any information about Dhia, but he does know about the house Sefalia purchased recently and her plans to renovate it. 
“That place belonged to a very wealthy man who died without any family to inherit it, so it ended up in rather bad shape while the legal system sorted it out. By then, it wasn’t worth much, and Sefalia was able to purchase it for a song, if you’ll excuse the turn of phrase.” 
Tahar knows the house’s exact location and gladly provides that information to the PCs. 
**XP Award**: If the PCs learn the location of the composer’s house, award them 80 XP.
