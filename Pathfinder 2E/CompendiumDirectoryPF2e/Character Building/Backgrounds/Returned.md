# Returned

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")






You died and miraculously returned with knowledge of the realms beyond death and a stronger link to life. Some dead and undead souls might feel a strange, instinctual kinship with you.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to **Constitution** or **Wisdom**, and one is a free ability boost.

You gain the [[Feats/Diehard|Diehard]] feat and the [[Feats/Additional Lore|Additional Lore]] feat for Boneyard Lore.
