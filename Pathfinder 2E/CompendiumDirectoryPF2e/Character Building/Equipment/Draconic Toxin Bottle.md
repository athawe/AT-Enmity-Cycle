# Draconic Toxin Bottle
## Item 7
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[air]][[consumable]][[cursed]][[magical]]

**Category** other; 
**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This glass bottle appears to be a dragon's breath potion of a specific dragon type (usually red) but has been polluted, making it toxic to use.

**Activate** `pf2:1` Interact

* * *

**Effect** You drink from the bottle and must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude check saving throw or become [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]] ([[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] on a critical failure) and immediately vomit the potion directly onto yourself, taking damage as though you had failed a save against a standard dragon's breath potion. If you succeed at your Fortitude save, you become sickened 1 but otherwise are able to unleash a breath weapon as normal for a dragon's breath potion of the appropriate type.
