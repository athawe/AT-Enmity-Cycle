Variant crocodile

Crocodiles can be found basking on riverbanks, lurking in swamps, or floating in lakes. They are usually are indistinguishable from logs when viewed from afar-at least until they attack. Alligators have similar statistics, but because they often live in more temperate climates, they endure cold temperatures better. Unlike alligators, crocodiles can tolerate salt water. Both are formidable predators that are likely to devour careless adventurers who fail to watch where they step.

* * *

Powerful and primeval in appearance, crocodiles are dangerous natural predators that dwell in marshes, riverbeds, swamps, and other wetlands.
