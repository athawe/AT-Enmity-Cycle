# Alchemical Discoveries
## Feat 4
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** alchemical sciences methodology
* * *
You've devoted extra time in the lab to improve your knowledge of alchemy. You learn the formulas for two alchemical items each time you level up instead of one; these must still be elixirs or tools.

The number of versatile vials you can create each day increases by 1 if you're an expert in Crafting, 2 if you're a master, or 3 if you're legendary.
