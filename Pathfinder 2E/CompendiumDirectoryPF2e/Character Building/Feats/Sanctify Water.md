# Sanctify Water `pf2:1`
## Feat 7
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** master in Religion; good or evil deity
* * *
You imbue water with your deity's blessing. Choose a container of water on your person that is of light Bulk. For 1 round, if you or an ally throw this container at a foe, it has the damaging effects of [[Equipment/Holy Water|Holy Water]] (if you follow a good deity) or [[Equipment/Unholy Water|Unholy Water]] (if you follow an evil deity). The water's transient power doesn't make it gain any value, allow it to be used to supply the cost for a spell or ritual, and so on. If you have legendary proficiency in Religion, you can sanctify three containers held by you or allies within your reach instead of one.
