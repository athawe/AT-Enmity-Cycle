The creature becomes [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 hour on a failed save (or [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 2]] for 1 hour on a critical failure)."

Trained from a young age with the strange and powerful shauth lashes, urdefhan lashers would rather die than retreat from combat.

Translucent-skinned scourges of the Darklands, urdefhans are remorseless killers and foot soldiers of the world's end.
