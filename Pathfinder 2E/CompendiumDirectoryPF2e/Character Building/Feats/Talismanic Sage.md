# Talismanic Sage
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Talisman Dabbler Dedication
* * *
You have forgotten more about talismans than lesser warriors have ever known. Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when you [[Actions/Affix a Talisman|Affix a Talisman]], you can specially treat one item you're working on, allowing it to have two active talismans at once.

This special treatment ends if you use Affix a Talisman to treat a new item for this ability.
