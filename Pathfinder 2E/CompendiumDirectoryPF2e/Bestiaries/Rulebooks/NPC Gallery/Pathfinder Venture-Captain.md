_The barnacle-crusted armor of this dwarf hints at a thousand exciting tales._

The venture-captains of the Pathfinder Society rose through the ranks of the organization by following a unique path. An individual venture-captain has overcome numerous challenges, and each has countless stories to tell-and the scars to go with them. Each venture-captain maintains a lodge somewhere in the Inner Sea, where Pathfinder agents can rest, share stories, and set out on new missions. The venture-captain assigns these missions themselves, and they can draw on the significant resources of the Pathfinder Society-as well as any local allies they have-to ensure the missions' success.

This venture-captain operates a lodge that also serves as a tavern. His interest in epic tales led him to join the Society, and he gladly shares these stories with interested parties. Opportunistic field agents can gain the venture-captain's favor by recovering unique and valuable liquors. The venture-captain hopes to one day publish a Pathfinder Chronicle of his own.

The Pathfinder Society is a large and influential organization seeking to learn and share their knowledge to others, and its members can be found even in the least likely of places. PCs who are members of the Pathfinder Society might accompany a Pathfinder field agent or get news and assignments from a Pathfinder venture-captain.
