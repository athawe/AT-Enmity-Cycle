The typical demon throng consists of a chaotic mix of less powerful demons—typically abrikandilus, dretches, and quasits, with a few brimoraks, babaus or other, more powerful demons swept up in the mayhem. This tangled mess of different creatures makes coordinated tactics untenable but, while individual demons in the throng might not be able to fully utilize their abilities, the throng itself makes up for these deficiencies with dangerous options of its own.

Demons are legion. Countless examples crowd the Abyss, many of which have yet to be categorized by mortal scholars. In the Abyss, might very much makes right, and so despite their chaotic nature, weaker demons often gather together to enjoy safety in numbers.

## Throng Abilities

Demon throngs are troops, as defined in Pathfinder Bestiary 3. They have the Troop Defenses, Troop Movement, and Form-Up abilities. They also have the demonic tide ability, which allows them to occupy the same space as other creatures, which is unusual for troops, and Serenity Vulnerability—a result of the troop's demonic nature.
