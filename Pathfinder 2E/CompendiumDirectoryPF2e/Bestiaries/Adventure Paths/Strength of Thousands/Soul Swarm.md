The soul swarm can choose to deal slashing damage as it cuts away at a creature, fire damage as it burns other souls away, or void damage as it attempts to unmake a soul. The damage depends on the number of actions.\n* * *\n\n`pf2:1` 2d6+1 damage: slashing, fire, negative\n\n`pf2:2` 4d6+11 damage: slashing, fire, negative\n\n`pf2:3` 6d6+11 damage: slashing, fire, negative"

  - name: "Troop Movement"
    desc: "  Whenever the soul swarm Strides, the soul swarm first Forms Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then moves. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving; for instance, if any square of the soul swarm enters difficult terrain, the extra movement cost applies to the whole soul swarm."
