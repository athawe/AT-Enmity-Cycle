  - name: "Independent Brains"
    desc: "  Each of Sulvik's heads rolls its own initiative and has its own turn. Neither head can [[Actions/Delay|Delay]]. At the start of a head's turn, that head gets 2 actions and 1 reaction. Each brain controls its own tongue and one of Sulvik's arms, but both can move the legs. Any ability that would sever Sulvik's head (such as the _[[Equipment/Vorpal|Vorpal]]_ weapon property) doesn't cause him to die if he has his other head, but does cause him to lose the turns, actions, and reactions of the severed head. Mental effects that target a single creature affect only one of Sulvik's heads."
