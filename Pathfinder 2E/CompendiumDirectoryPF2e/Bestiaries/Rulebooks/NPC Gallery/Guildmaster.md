In cities, artisans working in a common trade often form guilds to set standards of quality, establish common prices, engage in collective bargaining with business owners, and lobby local governments for favorable laws. The guildmaster-often a master artisan in their own right-also acts as an administrator and politician, advocating for artisans in their trade. The guildmaster is a 12th-level challenge when competing in crafting or their area of expertise (architecture in the example below).

Every settlement needs tradespeople to create new products, facilitate commerce, and keep the infrastructure from crumbling. Larger cities often have entire guilds dedicated to the creation of specific goods, managing worker conditions, and working with local governments.
