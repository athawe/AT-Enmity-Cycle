    desc: " (concentrate,exploration,occult,polymorph) The sea hag can make a bargain with a willing creature who must be of sound mind. The creature gives away a special or cherished qualityâ€”such as its courage, its beauty, or its voice. In exchange, the sea hag spends 1 minute polymorphing the creature into a form the target desires.\n\nThis functions as [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Change Shape|Change Shape]]. It might be a total transformation or just changing one or more aspects of the target's body, and it can't make the creature more than one size smaller or larger. The creature changes its Speeds as appropriate for the new form. It doesn't change the attack and damage bonuses with its Strikes, but it might change the damage type the Strikes deal. This has an unlimited duration, and as long as it's transformed, the creature is [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] and can't reduce its sickened condition below 2. The creature can slowly and carefully eat and drink despite being sickened. The only way to restore the lost quality used as payment is to defeat the sea hag or make another bargain for its return. Ending the bargain in this way also removes the transformation."

Sea hags specialize in transformation magic, preying on those who are desperate to change some aspect of their physical appearance. Targets often include those suffering from insecurity about their bodies or those desperate to reside in a different environment, such as aquatic creatures who wish to live on land. These hags are known for tempting desperate victims into tragic and excruciating bargains, though they're also happy to drown and eat mariners who stray too close to their dwellings.

A sea hag has the upper half of a humanoid and the lower half of an octopus, with translucent skin and glowing lights visible beneath their flesh. Sea hags can join covens, but their aquatic nature often prevents them from joining mixed covens with other kinds of hags.

Hags are malevolent predators who use magic and manipulation to lure children and young adults into their clutches. Though their true forms are eldritch and horrifying, hags spend much of their lives disguised as ordinary women. They seek out targets who are unhappy, innocent, or otherwise vulnerable, preying on their weaknesses before snatching them up. The typical hag is abusive, controlling, and narcissistic. Though less malicious hags possibly exist, they rarely reveal their true forms, making them nearly impossible to find.
