# Effect: Disarm (Success)
## Level 1
### 






Granted by a successful [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]]

* * *

You have a weakened grasp on an item. Further attempts to Disarm the item gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and you take a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item. You can end the effect by Interacting to change your grip on the item; otherwise, it lasts as long as you hold the item.
