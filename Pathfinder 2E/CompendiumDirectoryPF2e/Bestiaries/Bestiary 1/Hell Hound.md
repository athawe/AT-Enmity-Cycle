A hell hound's appearance dismisses any doubts as to its infernal origins-flesh the color of burning pitch, teeth as sharp as any fiend's pitchfork, and a shroud of ever-burning hellfire are all trademark features.

Hell hounds are fiendish, extraplanar canines hailing from the pit that can hunt down quarry and breathe supernatural gouts of flame. They are temperamental and quick to aggressive behavior.
