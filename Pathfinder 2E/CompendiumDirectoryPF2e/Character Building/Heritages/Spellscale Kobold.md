# Spellscale Kobold

### 






A trace of draconic magic flows through your veins. Choose one cantrip from the arcane spell list. You can Cast this Spell as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up. You gain the trained proficiency rank in arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs, and your key spellcasting ability is Charisma.
