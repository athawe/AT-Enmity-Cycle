## Notable Regions
Thuvia is bordered on the north by the Inner Sea, and this ready access to water created a narrow band of fertile land near the coast. Much of the terrain there, however, is rocky and hilly. The best farmlands in the northern part of the nation are along the coast from Merab to Aspenthar, where the soil is both fertile and easier to access for agriculture. The Junira River forms the eastern border with Osirion, and the slow-moving, broad waterway is used for trade and irrigation. The Turvanar River originates in the Barrier Wall mountains in southern Thuvia and joins with the Uta River as it flows northwest before the combined bodies of water empty into the Inner Sea. Their convergence and route to the sea marks the border between Thuvia and Rahadoum. The southern border of Thuvia is created by the Barrier Wall mountains. It’s difficult, imposing terrain and dangerous creatures have shaped the Thuvians who live there into survival experts in extreme conditions. Thuvia also claims two islands in the Inner Sea. Glasswall Isle is the larger and more visited. Sailors can see the smooth, glass-like cliffs along the isle’s northern shores shining like a beacon from miles away. The island hosts a bustling port on its much more accessible southern shores, with deep harbors close enough to be useful for passing ships. Wyvern’s Roost is the most northwesterly territory held by Thuvia and farther from the mainland than Glasswall Isle. Despite its name, few actual wyverns roost on the island’s cliffs. Instead, a sizable population of sea drakes live along its shores, attacking cargo ships moving to and from Rahadoum. The majority of Thuvia’s interior is a vast, sandy desert. While there are many places where the dunes seemingly stretch on forever, the desert also offers rocky hills, low mountain ranges, deep ravines and valleys, and several hundred oases. Numerous plants and animals live here, adapted to the arid climate, all of them experts at collecting and retaining what moisture they can find.
- The microregion from Nuat in the west to Katapesh in the east is called the [[Golden Road]].

## Factions
Aside from the nomads practicing traditional ways of life, there are numerous creatures and factions: the Water Lords who control many oases, the ever-present divs, scattered cells of Usij cultists, and the ancient blue dragon drug lord, Deyrubrujan, just to name a few.

## History
Modern Thuvia owes its existence to a single export: the sun orchid elixir. This remarkable potion can reverse the effects of aging, making it perhaps the single most valuable product in the entire Inner Sea. The six vials sold each year make up the bulk of Thuvia’s annual income. The five city-states of Thuvia—Merab, Aspenthar, Lamasara, Pashow, and Duwwor—share a rotating schedule of the sale.

Although a number nomadic peoples have long called it home, little information remains of Thuvia prior to the Age of Destiny. Thuvia’s recorded history begins in –3250 ar, when a group of city-states banded together to form the Tekritanin League. With the Jistka Imperium to the west and ancient Osirion to the east, this union hoped to maintain its own territory during the many clashes of those two nations. As time wore on, however, the league allied itself more with Osirion and famously used its devastating desert-hardened camelry in several important battles against the Imperium 

Osirion’s influence overshadowed the league and, at the defeat of Jistka, the league’s city-states became mere vassals to Osirion. This vassalage ended in –1452 AR when Osirion, tired of the frequent uprisings and constant grumbling of the league’s members, razed several of the city-states, claimed the territory as its own, and named the province Thuvia. This relationship lasted for 600 years, until a group of Thuvian dissidents, assassinated the governor in a bid to cast off the yoke of Osirion. Already weak from internal and external struggles alike and in a sharp decline of influence, Osirion simply abandoned the province. Despite several attempts by various warlords and other leaders, no one was able to reunite Thuvia for another 600 years. 
Thuvia finally became a nation of its own not through military might, but the efforts of the sun orchid elixir’s creator, Artokus Kirran. In 1140 ar he approached the leaders of the five cities in the former province to form an alliance of mutual protection and share the profits from the sale of the **sun orchid elixir**. The city states established a rotation for hosting the annual sale that lasts to this day: Merab, Aspenthar, Lamasara, Pashow, Duwwor. In the current year, 4723 ar, the auction is taking place in Merab. This relationship has remained in place ever since and, while tensions have always been present between the cities, the benefit of remaining in an alliance has always outweighed any reason to break it.

### General Notes
- Most humans are part Garundi, that ethnic group of people have lived here for thousands of years. 
- While they can be found anywhere on the Material Plane, divs (Bestiary 3 68) are especially plentiful in Thuvia. Many enter this world through the House of Oblivion and spread across Golarion like a contagion. People often encounter these fiends in disguise, making travelers wary of random roadside encounters or strange-acting animals.
