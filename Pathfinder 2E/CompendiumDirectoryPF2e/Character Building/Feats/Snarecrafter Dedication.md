# Snarecrafter Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting; Snare Crafting
* * *
You've learned to create a limited number of snares at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you can prepare four snares from your formula book for quick deployment; if they normally take 1 minute to [[Actions/Craft|Craft]], you can Craft them with 3 [[Actions/Interact|Interact]] actions. The number of snares increases to six if you're a master in Crafting and eight if you're legendary.

Snares prepared in this way don't cost you any resources to Craft.

* * *

**Special** The feat counts as [[Feats/Snare Specialist|Snare Specialist]] for the purpose of feat prerequisites. If you also have the Snare Specialist ranger feat, the [[Feats/Quick Snares|Quick Snares]] from both feats are cumulative. You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Snarecrafter|Snarecrafter]] archetype.
