Green hags hate beauty and purity, so they use disguises and treachery to lure and murder innocents, corrupt the pure of heart, and shatter the minds and morals of their victims. Green hags create imaginative schemes to utterly ruin anyone who crosses them, as well as good or righteous folk whose very existence insults the hag's twisted sensibilities. The complicated scandals perpetuated by green hags involve impersonation, mistaken identity, the seduction and betrayal of loved ones, or all these things in combination.

* * *

Malevolent crones who lurk at the edges of civilization, hags use their deceptive, magical abilities to prey upon humanoids, manipulating and corrupting them. Some say hags arose from fey that became twisted by their inner selfishness. Hags gather together in covens for greater power, craft unique magical items known as _[[Equipment/Hag Eye|Hag Eyes]]_, and are known to replace infant humanoids with their own offspring-these children are [[Bestiary 1/Changeling Exile|Changelings]] who have the potential to become hags themselves.
