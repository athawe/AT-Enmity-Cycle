Not only are owlbear eggs delicious when boiled, but when infused with a mix of alchemical reagents, they also make you emit a long screech much like an owlbear's. All creatures in a 30-foot emanation must attempt a DC 23 Will check save. Regardless of the result, creatures in the area are temporarily immune to this screech for 1 minute.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 1]].

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 2]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 3]] and [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round.
