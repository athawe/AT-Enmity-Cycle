# Invigorating Mercy
## Feat 6
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mercy
* * *
Your divine touch rejuvenates the weak and tired.

When you use [[Feats/Mercy|Mercy]], you can instead attempt a counteract check to remove the [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy]] or [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled]] conditions, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract rank and DC.

If the condition was caused by an ongoing effect and you don't remove that effect, the condition returns at the end of your next turn.
