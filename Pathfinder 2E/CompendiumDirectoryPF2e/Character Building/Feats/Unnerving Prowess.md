## Feat 6
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Aldori Duelist Dedication
* * *
**Trigger** You critically succeed at a Strike or Disarm with your Aldori dueling sword.

Your incredible skill with your blade unnerves your foes. You attempt to [[Actions/Demoralize|Demoralize]] the target of your Strike or [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]]. This Demoralize attempt does not have the auditory trait, nor do you take a penalty to the check if the target doesn't understand your language.
