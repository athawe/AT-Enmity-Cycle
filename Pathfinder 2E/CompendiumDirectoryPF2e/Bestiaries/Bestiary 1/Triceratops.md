Triceratopses are muscular quadrupeds with powerful but short legs, thick necks, and heads crowned by a wide, bony frill. Though they bear a large horn on their snout and one on each brow, these dinosaurs are herbivores and use these bony protrusions only to defend themselves from attackers or in dramatic clashes against other triceratopses for grazing territory or mates. Short-tempered and obstinate, triceratopses are unlikely to back down from a fight unless they are hopelessly outmatched, and the creatures are known to fight to the death for no apparent reason beyond stubbornness. Triceratopses often serve as mounts for lizardfolk, orcs, and giants, who ride comfortably behind the dinosaurs' protective bone frills. A triceratops is 30 feet long and weighs as much as 10 tons.

Triceratopses are surely the most well-known of the dinosaurs known as ceratopids, but many others exist. For example, the smaller styracosauruses have only one horn but several horn-like protrusions on their frills.

Remnants from the world's primeval era, these enormous reptilian animals still exist in large numbers in isolated and remote wildernesses or far underground within magical Darklands caverns. Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other monstrous humanoids sometimes use dinosaurs as mounts, guards, or hunting animals. Humans and other ancestries have also been known to collect dinosaurs, be it to display them in menageries or keep them as exotic pets or guardians. Such activities are generally pursuits of the rich or eccentric, but certain druids and other guardians of nature feel strong kinships with dinosaurs as well and take them on as companions. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions beyond their normal habitats, it is generally the result of these captive creatures escaping into the wild.
