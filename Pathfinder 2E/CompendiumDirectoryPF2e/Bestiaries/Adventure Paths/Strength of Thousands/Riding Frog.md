The creature isn't [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]], but it can't move beyond the reach of the frog's tongue. A creature can sever the tongue with a Strike against AC 13 that deals at least 2 slashing damage.\n\nThis deals no damage to the frog but prevents it from using its tongue Strike until it regrows its tongue, which takes a week."
