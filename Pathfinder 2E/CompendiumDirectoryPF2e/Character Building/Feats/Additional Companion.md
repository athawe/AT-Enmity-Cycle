# Additional Companion
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Beastmaster Dedication
* * *
Another animal joins you in your travels. It is a young animal companion that has the minion trait. See Beastmaster Animal Companions (in Beastmaster Dedication) for rules on how having multiple animal companions works.

**Special** You can select this feat more than once, gaining an additional animal companion each time, to a maximum of four total companions (including the one you gained from Beastmaster Dedication and possibly one you gained from sources other than the beastmaster archetype).
