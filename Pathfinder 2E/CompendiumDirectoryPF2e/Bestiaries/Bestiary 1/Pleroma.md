    desc: "`pf2:2` (incapacitation,magical) Three times per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere of white energy that hovers above its left hand. By using a single action, which has the concentrate trait, the pleroma can cause the sphere to fly 10 feet. The sphere can move in any direction, ignoring difficult terrain, but it can't move farther than 300 feet away from the pleroma.\n\nWherever the sphere travels, it leaves behind a 5-foot-wide path of new matter, creating either new terrain (the pleroma's choice of normal, difficult, or greater difficult terrain) or a 5-foot-square solid barrier of a single natural substance (such as clay, wood, or stone).\n\nThe sphere can enter the space of a creature; when it does, the creature must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude check save or be absorbed into the sphere. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to a space of the GM's choice away from the sphere. Those who fail take 20d6 vitality damage (even if they are living) and are pushed away as a success. Those who critically fail, or are reduced to 0 HP by the damage from a failure, become one with the new material and can be restored only via a 10th-rank spell.\n\nA pleroma can have only one Sphere of Creation in existence at a time, and the sphere automatically vanishes in a flash of blinding light after 1d4 minutes.\n\nAll creatures within 30 feet of the sphere of creation when it vanishes must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude check save or be permanently [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]]."

    desc: "`pf2:2` (incapacitation,magical) Three times per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere of complete and utter darkness that hovers above its right hand. By using a single action, which has the concentrate trait, the pleroma can cause the sphere to fly 10 feet. The sphere can move in any direction, ignoring difficult terrain, but it can't move farther than 300 feet away from the pleroma.\n\nThe sphere is an empty void that lasts for 1 minute before collapsing in on itself and winking out of existence.\n\nOnce manifested, the sphere can be used as a ranged attack, but it blinks out of existence immediately after that attack is resolved. Any unattended object that touches the void is sucked in and completely destroyed. Larger objects (such as ships or buildings) are destroyed at a rate of one 10-foot cube per round of contact.\n\nThe sphere can enter the space of a creature; when it does, the creature must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude check save or be absorbed into the sphere. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to a space of the GM's choice away from the sphere. Those who fail take 20d6 void damage (even to undead) and are pushed away as a success. Those who critically fail, or are reduced to 0 HP by the damage from a failure, are annihilated and can be restored only via a 10th-rank spell."

Among the most powerful of all the true aeons, pleromas are a manifestation of the duality of creation and destruction. Their physical manifestation is a constant state of flux between these two poles, their forms a shifting cloak of black where galaxies and other celestial objects flit in and out of existence, as if depicting the constant life, death, and rebirth of a miniature, self-contained universe.

Pleromas see the multiverse as both eternal and cyclical, doomed and malleable, ending only if these cycles ever become unbalanced. They believe the current Convergence is necessary to obtain this essential balance, and act to ensure that the grand design of the Monad is carried out to the smallest detail.

* * *

Aeons have always been the caretakers of reality and defenders of the natural order of balance. Each type of aeon takes on some form of duality in its manifestation and works either to shape the multiverse within the aspects of this duality in some way, or to correct imbalances to the perfect order of existence. Aeons can bring weal or woe when they appear in a region, and their machinations can raise a nation, raze it, or restore it from ruin. Their reasons are their own, and they rarely share their motivations with others-they simply create the results they insist through their strange envisioning communication are necessary to maintain the balance of the multiverse.

As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons' war against imbalance-particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.

Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the "Convergence." At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons-but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How-or if-this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.
