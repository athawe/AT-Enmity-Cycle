The monstrous giant anaconda is a constrictor snake capable of swallowing whole creatures as big as horsesâ€”to say nothing of their riders. Although novice bushwhackers watch out for snakes that might drop on them from the jungle canopy above, giant anacondas are most commonly encountered in ponds and rivers, where they feed on prey including manatees and capybaras. This hunting tactic allows anacondas to drown their prey while constricting it, reducing the chance of injuries while hunting. Despite lurid and sensational stories spread by adventurers, these snakes rarely attack humanoids.

* * *

Snakes come in an array of forms, from jungle-dwelling constrictors that wrap around their prey to venomous vipers with deadly bites. Regardless, all snakes consume their prey whole by unhinging their jaws and using powerful muscles to move the food down their throats and into their stomachs.
