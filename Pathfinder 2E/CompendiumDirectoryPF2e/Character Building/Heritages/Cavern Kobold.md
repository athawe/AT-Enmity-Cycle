# Cavern Kobold

### 






You hatched into a warren among narrow tunnels and countless kin. Your body is flexible.

When [[Actions/Climb|Climbing]] rock walls, stalactites, and other natural stone features, you move at half your Speed on a success and at full Speed on a critical success (and you move at full Speed on a success if you have [[Feats/Quick Climb|Quick Climb]]). This doesn't affect you if you're using a climb Speed.

If you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Squeeze|Squeeze]], you get a critical success instead.
