# Well-Groomed
## Feat 9
### [[catfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are fastidious about keeping yourself clean, whether licking your fur or carefully using traditional catfolk hygiene products, to salubrious effect.

You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease, you get a critical success instead.
