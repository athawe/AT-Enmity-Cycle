# Ghlaunder - Minor Boon

### 






**Minor Boon:** Your commitment to filth draws a small cloud of disease-laden insects. Once, you can summon a cloud of midges, mosquitos, and flies to surround you for 1 minute. Creatures adjacent to you at any point during that time become [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 1]], [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 1]], and exposed to a blood-borne illness. Ghlaunder typically grants this boon when you can infect a significant number of creatures.
