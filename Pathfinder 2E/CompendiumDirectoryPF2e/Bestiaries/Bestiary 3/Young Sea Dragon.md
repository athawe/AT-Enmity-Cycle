Sea dragons' affinity with water grants them mastery over rain, storms, and floods. Those whose livelihoods are at the mercy of the weather and waves frequently venerate these great aquatic creatures. Most sea dragons respond kindly to requests, but, like the sea, they can be unpredictable and fickle.

Sea dragons have disk-shaped scales like fish and webbed claws as well as large back and tail fins to aid in swimming. They appear in vivid and vibrant colors, like aquatic wildlife. Underwater flora and fauna grow and thrive upon older sea dragons, and ancient sea dragons often have a head of coral around their antlers, giving them the image of being crowned royalty.

Imperial dragons, namesake of the Dragon Empires and guardians of Tian Xia before humanity arrived, embody five strengthening and counteracting forces. Unlike other true dragons, imperial dragons dive deep into human affairs. Some remain secretive, posing as reclusive hermits, while others keep a high profile, openly ruling factions. Tian cultures in turn venerate the dragons, depicting gods in the form of dragons or claiming ancestry from them. Not all are adored, for plenty of these creatures act wickedly.

**Draconic Cycles**

Five elements underpin the magical powers of imperial dragons, influencing their relationships to all things and, especially, to others of their kind. These elements interlink in two cycles. In the first cycle, each element feeds one other: wood feeds fire, fire feeds earth, earth feeds metal, metal feeds water, and water feeds wood. In the second cycle, each element counters another: wood counters earth, earth counters water, water counters fire, fire counters metal, and metal counters wood.

Each imperial dragon represents one element and has four abilities related to the cycle. For example, the forest dragon-linked to wood-feeds fire, is fed by water, counters earth, and is countered by metal.
