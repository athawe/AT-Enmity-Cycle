Lions are cooperative hunters, ambushing dangerous prey in groups of lionesses that work in tandem to trap and kill their prey. Male lions are typically larger, with long manes, and when they hunt, they tend to do so on their own.

Few predators of the natural world can match the cat's talent for stalking and stealth. Large cats can be found in almost any environment, usually keeping their distance from settlements. When civilization encroaches onto a big cat's hunting grounds, the animals are often driven to making desperate attacks against unwary travelers.
