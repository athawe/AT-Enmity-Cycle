The Environmental Features table (below) lists the features of various environments alphabetically for quick reference. The Proficiency DC Band entry indicates a range of appropriate simple DCs for that environmental feature, while also providing a rough estimate of the danger or complexity of the feature.

Use the Environmental Damage table to determine damage from an environment or natural disaster. When deciding the exact damage amount, use your best judgment based on how extreme you deem the danger to be.
**Wild Weather**
Only the most extreme temperatures have a direct impact on the PCs during an encounter, but a slog through blistering heat or freezing cold can leave the PCs worn out and more vulnerable to foes. Light levels play a key role in both outdoor and indoor encounters.

> [!NOTE]- Terrain Rules
> Environments make frequent use of the rules for difficult terrain, greater difficult terrain, and hazardous terrain, so those rules are summarized here.  
> 
> **Difficult terrain** is any terrain that impedes movement, ranging from particularly rough or unstable surfaces to thick ground cover and countless other impediments. Moving into a square of difficult terrain (or moving 5 feet into or within an area of difficult terrain, if you're not using a grid) costs an extra 5 feet of movement. Moving into a square of **greater difficult terrain** instead costs 10 additional feet of movement. This additional cost is not increased when moving diagonally. Creatures can't normally Step into difficult terrain.  
> 
> Any movement creatures make while jumping ignores terrain that the creature is jumping over. Some abilities (such as flight or being incorporeal) allow creatures to avoid the movement reduction from some types of difficult terrain. Certain other abilities let creatures ignore difficult terrain while traveling on foot; such an ability also allows a creature to move through greater difficult terrain using the movement cost for difficult terrain, but unless the ability specifies otherwise, these abilities don't let creatures ignore greater difficult terrain.  
> 
> **Hazardous terrain** damages creatures whenever they move through it. For instance, an acid pool, a pit of burning embers, and a spike-filled passageway all constitute hazardous terrain. The amount and type of damage depend on the specific hazardous terrain.  

Desert encompasses sandy and rocky deserts as well as badlands. Though tundra is technically a desert, it’s classified as arctic, as the climate is the primary challenge in such areas. Sandy deserts often have quicksand hazards and sandstorms.  

### Rubble
Rocky deserts are strewn with rubble, which is **difficult terrain**. Rubble dense enough to be walked over rather than navigated through is **uneven ground**.  

### Sand
Packed sand doesn’t usually significantly impede a character’s movement, but loose sand is either **difficult terrain** (if it’s shallow) or **uneven ground** (if it’s deep). The wind in a desert often shifts sand into dunes, hills of loose sand with **uneven ground** facing the wind and steeper inclines away from the wind.

### QUICKSAND HAZARD 3 
COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL 
**Stealth** +12 (trained) (or –10 and no minimum proficiency if the surface is disturbed) 
**Description** A 15-foot-wide patch of water and sand attempts to submerge creatures that step onto it. 
**Disable** *DC 18 Survival* (trained) to disturb the surface 
**Submerge** `pf2:0` **Trigger** A Huge or smaller creature walks onto the quicksand; 
**Effect** The triggering creature sinks into the quicksand up to its waist. The quicksand rolls initiative if it hasn’t already. 
**Routine** (1 action) On its initiative, the quicksand pulls down each creature within it. A creature that was submerged up to its waist becomes submerged up to its neck, and a creature that was submerged up to its neck is pulled under and has to hold its breath to avoid suffocation (Player Core 437). 
A creature in the quicksand can attempt a *DC 20 Athletics check* to Swim to either raise itself by one step if it’s submerged to its neck or worse, or to move 5 feet if it’s submerged only up to its waist. On a critical failure, the creature is pulled down one step. A creature that Swims out of the quicksand escapes the hazard and is prone in a space adjacent to the quicksand patch. Other creatures can *Aid* the creature, typically by using a rope or similar aid, or attempt to pull the creature out with their own *DC 20 Athletics check*, with the same results as if the creature attempted the check. 
**Reset** The hazard still submerges anyone who walks in, but the surface doesn’t become hidden again until it settles over the course of 24 hours.

## Mountain
Mountain environments also include hills, which share many aspects of mountains, though not their more extreme features. The most common disasters here are avalanches.  
### Chasms  
Chasms are natural pits, typically at least 20 feet long and clearly visible (barring mundane or magical efforts to conceal them). The main danger posed by a chasm is that characters must **Long Jump** to get across. Alternatively, characters can take the safer but slower route of **Climbing** down the near side of the chasm and then ascending the far side to get across.  
### Cliffs
Cliffs and rock walls require creatures to **Climb** to ascend or descend. Without extensive safety precautions, a critical failure on Climb checks can result in significant falling damage.  
### Rubble
Mountains often have extremely rocky areas or shifting, gravelly scree that makes for **difficult terrain**. Especially deep or pervasive rubble is **uneven ground**.  
### Slopes
Slopes vary from the gentle rises of normal terrain to **difficult terrain** and inclines, depending on the angle of elevation. Moving down a slope is typically normal terrain, but characters might need to **Climb** up particularly steep slopes.
### Undergrowth
Light undergrowth is common in mountains. It is **difficult terrain** and allows a character to Take Cover.

## [Urban](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2795)
Urban environments include open city spaces as well as buildings. The building information in this section also applies to ruins and constructed dungeons.
### Doors, Gates, and Walls
Some of the most common obstacles that characters face in urban areas and dungeons are doors, gates, and walls.  
#### Climbing
The table below gives the typical DC for Athletics checks to **Climb** a structure, which is usually a simple DC. You might adjust the difficulty based on the specifics of the structure and environment.  
#### Demolishing
A character might want to smash their way through a door, a window, or certain walls. The Hardness, Hit Point, and Broken Threshold values provided in the table below are based on the material the structure is typically made out of, so a portcullis made of iron, for example, has a higher Hardness than one of wood. For more on damaging objects, see Player Core 269.  
Strong walls, such as well-maintained masonry or hewn stone, can't be broken without dedicated work and proper tools. Getting through such walls requires downtime.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Door**|**Climb DC**|**Hardness, HP (BT)**|
|Wood|20|10, 40 (20)|
|Stone|30|14, 56 (28)|
|Reinforced wood|15|15, 60 (30)|
|Iron|30|18, 72 (36)|
|**Wall**|**Climb DC**|**Hardness, HP (BT)**|
|Crumbling masonry|15|10, 40 (20)|
|Wooden slats|15|10, 40 (20)|
|Masonry|20|14, 56 (28)|
|Hewn stone|30|14, 56 (28)|
|Iron|40|18, 72 (36)|
|**Portcullis**|**Climb DC**|**Hardness, HP (BT)**|
|Wood|10|10, 40 (20)|
|Iron|10|18, 72 (36)|

### Forcing Open
Structures that can be opened—such as doors, gates, and windows—can be **Forced Open** using Athletics. This is usually necessary only if they’re locked or stuck. The DC to Force Open a structure uses the Thievery DC of its lock but adjusts it to be very hard (increasing the DC by 5). If there’s no lock, use the following table; when lifting a portcullis, use the lock DC or the DC from the table, whichever is higher.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Structure**|**Force Open DC**|
|Stuck door or window|15|
|Exceptionally stuck|20|
|Lift wooden portcullis|20|
|Lift iron portcullis|30|
|Bend metal bars|30|

### Crowds
Crowded thoroughfares and similar areas are **difficult terrain**, or **greater difficult terrain** if an area is truly packed with people. You might allow a character to get a crowd to part using *Diplomacy, Intimidation, or Performance*.    
A crowd exposed to an obvious danger, like a fire or a rampaging monster, attempts to move away from the danger as quickly as possible, but it is slowed by its own mass. A fleeing crowd typically moves at the Speed of an average member each round (**usually 25 feet**), potentially trampling or leaving behind slower-moving members of the crowd.
### Streets 
Streets are generally paved with cobblestones. If the cobblestones are in poor repair, they could be **difficult terrain or uneven ground**.

## [Climate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2814)
Weather is more than just set dressing to establish mood—it has mechanical effects you can combine with environmental components to create a more memorable encounter. Weather can impose circumstance penalties on certain checks, from –1 to –4 based on severity.
### Temperature
Often, temperature doesn't impose enough of a mechanical effect to worry about beyond describing the clothing the characters need to wear to be comfortable. Particularly hot and cold weather can make creatures *fatigued* more quickly during overland travel and can cause damage if harsh enough, as shown in the Temperature Effects table below.  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Category**|**Temperature**|**Fatigue**|**Damage**|
|Incredible cold|-80º F or colder (-62º C or colder)|2 hours|Moderate cold every minute|
|Extreme cold|-79º F to -21º F (-61º C to -29º C)|4 hours|Minor cold every 10 minutes|
|Severe cold|-20º F to 12º F (-28º C to -11º C)|4 hours|Minor cold every hour|
|Mild cold|13º F to 32º F (-10º C to 0º C)|4 hours|None|
|Normal|33º F to 94º F (1º C to 34º C)|8 hours|None|
|Mild heat|95º F* to 104º F* (35º C to 40º C)|4 hours|None|
|Severe heat|105º F* to 114º F (41º C to 45º C)|4 hours|Minor fire every hour|
|Extreme heat|115º F to 139º F (46º C to 59º C)|4 hours|Minor fire every 10 minutes|
|Incredible heat|140º F or warmer (60º C or warmer)|2 hours|Moderate fire every minute|

* Adjust temperatures down by 15º F (9º C) in areas of high humidity  
### Wind
Wind imposes a **circumstance penalty on auditory Perception checks** depending on its strength. It also interferes with **physical ranged attacks** such as arrows, imposing a circumstance penalty to attack rolls involving such weapons, and potentially making attacks with them impossible in powerful windstorms. Wind snuffs out handheld flames; lanterns protect their flame from the wind, but particularly powerful winds can extinguish these as well.  
#### Moving in Wind
Wind is **difficult or greater difficult terrain when Flying**. Moving in wind of sufficient strength requires a Maneuver in Flight action, and fliers are blown away on a critical failure or if they don't succeed at a minimum of one such check each round.    
Even on the ground, particularly strong winds might require a creature to succeed at an **Athletics check to move**, knocking the creature back and prone on a critical failure. On such checks, Small creatures typically take a –1 circumstance penalty, and Tiny creatures typically take a –2 penalty.

## Natural Disasters
### Sandstorms
Mild sandstorms and dust storms don’t present much more danger than a windy rainstorm, but they can cause damage to a creature’s lungs and spread diseases across long distances. Heavy sandstorms deal *minor slashing damage* each round to those exposed to the sand, force creatures to hold their breath to avoid suffocation, or both.  

### Tornadoes
In a tornado's path, wind conditions impose severe circumstance penalties, but creatures that would normally be blown away are instead picked up in the tornado's funnel, where they take massive bludgeoning damage from flying debris as they rise through the cone until they are eventually expelled (taking bludgeoning damage from falling).  
  
Tornadoes usually travel around 300 feet per round (roughly 30 miles per hour). They normally travel a few miles before dissipating. Some tornadoes are stationary or travel much faster.
## Weather 

| 2d6 | Weather                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2   | Khamsin; extreme heat, minor slashing damage per round, extra slow travel, -4 to auditory Perception checks and physical ranged attacks, dim light, chances of elemental encounters skyrocket |
| 3   | Heavy Sandstorm; severe heat, minor slashing damage per round, slow travel, -2 to auditory Perception checks and physical ranged attacks, dim light (concealment)                             |
| 4-5 | Mild Sandstorm, -2 to auditory Perception checks, dim light                                                                                                                                   |
| 6-7 | Partly cloudy; no adverse effects                                                                                                                                                             |
| 8-9 | Full Sun; mild heat                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 10  | Full Sun; severe heat, minor fire damage every hour                                                                                                                                           |
| 11  | Heat wave; extreme heat, minor fire damage every 10 minutes                                                                                                                                   |
| 12  | Tornado; roll d12 for what direction it's in, then again for what direction its heading                                                                                                       |

Maybe roll a d12x2 to see how many hours adverse weather occurs for?

A **khamsin** is a powerful seasonal wind storm that often carries great amounts of dust and sand with it. It is most commonly encountered in the deserts of [Osirion](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Osirion "Osirion"), where the seasonal khamsins are capable of causing great destruction, and are capable of burying entire cities and regions. These storms are thought to be the product of fighting between the numerous tribes of [elementals](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Elemental "Elemental") who occupy that nation's empty places. Khamsin storms appear with such regularity, that they shape Osirion's national character, economy, and landscape as profoundly as the yearly flooding of the [River Sphinx](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/River_Sphinx "River Sphinx").

## Hexploration
<sup>GM Core p. 170</sup>
While you can represent long, heroic journeys using normal exploration, if you want something more detailed, you can use the hexploration subsystem instead. This is a method where the overland map is divided into individual hexagonal sections of territory. During their exploration, the PCs travel through and explore individual hexes, finding interesting sites, secrets, resources, and dangers.

The pace of travel is measured in days rather than hours or minutes. This means choosing hexploration activities are more akin to choosing downtime activities than exploration activities. Each day, the PCs explore or travel through a region of the wilderness measured in hexes on a map to survey, discover resources, forage, find sites, and reconnoiter potential foes and allies.

Hexploration is ideal for sandbox-style campaigns, where the players are at liberty to set the course of their own adventure. The GM populates a region with interesting locations and situations that the players explore in any order they see fit.

### Designing a Hexploration Map

The best way to map the area is with a hex grid. Each hex represents a discreet area *12 miles* from corner to corner, which can be traveled across and explored in about 1 day even by slower-moving groups. Hexes track the distance the party travels while exploring and define the bounds of certain types of terrain.

When designing your hex map, it's best to have each hex represent one primary terrain type. This doesn't mean that's the only feature of the land in this hex, but it is the predominant type and represents the challenges of traveling across and exploring that hex. You can also give your hex other elements: a river or a road might snake through the area, or it could contain a castle, cave, village, fort, or some other type of encounter setting. You can quickly draw your map using just a few colors, some basic symbols, and letters or numbers for reference.

But this is only the start. This detailed map is your GM map, holding all the secrets for the PCs to discover. Give the players a blank map that they can fill in as they explore the wilderness hex by hex. The more they explore, the more their map will look like yours.
#### Populating Hexes
When populating a hexploration map, keep in mind that you have little control over which areas the players choose to explore first—or if they'll explore those areas at all. Because hexploration leads to nonlinear, player-guided play, consider providing hooks within encounters and sites for them to explore in several directions from their starting point. You can provide some direction by presenting jobs like exploring a site on behalf of an NPC, escorting travelers, delivering goods, or scouting a region for a local noble. This typically leads to a set encounter (see below).

##### Set Encounters
Even a sandbox adventure has a story or is the setting of multiple stories. Set encounters, be they just a simple encounter or an entire adventuring site, can serve as important beats in the story behind the PCs' exploration. These are typically the points on the hex maps the PCs are searching for, and the discovery of one set encounter will often incorporate story points that lead to the next.

##### Random Encounters
You can instill additional danger into your hexploration by including random encounters, whether they take the form of *interesting features, natural hazards, or creatures native to the terrain*. It can help to create a series of short lists in advance, each including a mix of three types of encounters: *harmless, hazards, and creature encounters*. Then create tables to randomize the results, or simply pick whichever encounter you think would work best for your hexploration narrative when these encounters occur (as described in Random Encounters on page 173). It's often easier to create a list by terrain rather than for each hex. The forest hexes could have their own random encounter list while the plains beyond have a different list, possibly with some overlap.

A harmless encounter is just that: the party is in no danger from it. Harmless encounters can be opportunities to flesh out the world with interesting bits of set-dressing, like a shrine on the side of the road dedicated to a minor god, opportunities for the party to interact with other travelers, or simply interesting or noteworthy moments on the road, like a distant and dazzling electrical storm.

Creature encounters can use the creatures found in the *Monster Core*, or you can create your own using the rules found in Building Creatures on page 112.

Plan your hazard and monster encounters with a degree of flexibility so you can tailor them to the PCs' current level, perhaps by creating a lower-level encounter and including notes on how to scale it up. Alternatively, if you want to run a more challenging or open-world hexploration, don't adapt to your players at all. Make a variety of encounters, some of which are so powerful that the correct tactic is to flee. You can even create a chase to make the escape exciting (see Chases on page 192)

##### Terrain
While each hex should have a predominant terrain type, your terrain can come alive using the info in the Environment section on pages 90-97. A hex might also include a river or road. These can cut through the terrain, making it easier for the PCs to travel through the hex, so long as they follow the path. Additionally, each hex might have special features like resources and secrets (see the Types of Terrain sidebar on page 209)

### Running Hexploration
Once you have your hexploration map ready, it's time for the PCs to start exploring! Each day, the PCs decide how they plan on exploring, either learning more about their current hex or traversing a new hex. They do this by declaring one or more hexploration activities for the day.

These activities take two forms: group or individual. The number of hexploration activities a group can accomplish each day is based on the Speed of their slowest member. If a group is willing to split up, faster members can perform more hexploration activities based on their own Speed, but such a decision may be deadly given the threat of random encounters. A group moving at a Speed of 10 feet or less is so slow it can't even traverse an open hex in a single day; it takes such a group 2 days for each hexploration activity.

| Speed | Activities per Day |
|-------|--------------------|
| 10 feet or less | 1/2 |
| 15–25 feet | 1 |
| 30–40 feet | 2 |
| 45–55 feet | 3 |
| 60 feet or more | 4 |

This rate assumes the PCs are taking time to camp and rest at healthy intervals. When a new day of hexploration begins, the group can decide to take a forced march as long as no one in the group is [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued). Doing so allows them to gain an extra Travel activity (or perform a full Travel activity each day if their Speed is 10 feet or less), but this is the only activity they can perform that day. A character can participate in a forced march safely for a number of days equal to the character's Constitution modifier (minimum 1 day). Any additional days of forced march make the character [fatigued](rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) until they spend an entire day of downtime resting.

#### Group Activities
Group activities require the entire party to work together in order to be effective; these activities each count as one of the day's hexploration activities for the whole group. For instance, if the group had 2 hexploration activities per day and decided to Travel and Reconnoiter, no one would have any additional hexploration activities that day. There are two group activities: Travel and Reconnoiter.


**Travel**
MOVE
You progress toward moving into an adjacent hex. In open terrain, like a plain, using 1 Travel activity allows you to move from one hex to an adjacent hex. Traversing a hex with difficult terrain (such as a typical forest or desert) requires 2 Travel activities, and hexes of greater difficult terrain (such as a steep mountain or typical swamp) require 3 Travel activities to traverse. Traveling along a road uses a terrain type one step better than the surrounding terrain. For example, if you are traveling on a road over a mountain pass, the terrain is difficult terrain instead of greater difficult terrain.

The Travel activity assumes you are walking overland. If you are flying or traveling on water, most hexes are open terrain, though there are exceptions. Flying into storms or high winds count as difficult or greater difficult terrain. Traveling down a river is open terrain, but traveling upriver is difficult or greater difficult terrain.

**Reconnoiter**
CONCENTRATE
You spend time surveying and exploring a specific area, getting the lay of the land and looking for unusual features and specific sites. Reconnoitering a single hex takes a number of hexploration activities equal to the number of Travel activities necessary to traverse the hex—1 for open terrain, 2 for difficult terrain, and 3 for greater difficult terrain. Traveling on roads doesn't lessen the time required to Reconnoiter. Once the hex has been Reconnoitered, you can Map the Area to reduce your chance of getting lost in that hex (see below). You automatically find any special feature that doesn't require a check to find, and you attempt the appropriate checks to find hidden special features.

For instance, if you were looking for an obvious rock formation among some hills, you would spend 2 hexploration activities to Reconnoiter the hex, and you'd find the rock formation. But if you were looking for a hidden tengu monastery somewhere in some deep forests, after spending 2 activities to Reconnoiter the forest hex, you would have to succeed at a Perception check as part of your Reconnoiter activity to find the monastery.


#### Individual Activities
Not all hexploration activities need to be accomplished as a group. In place of using a hexploration activity to Travel or Reconnoiter, each individual group member can instead perform one of these individual activities.

**Fortify Camp**  
You can spend time fortifying your camp for defense with a successful [Crafting](compendium/skills.md#Crafting) check (typically at a trained or expert DC). Anyone keeping watch or defending the camp gains a +2 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls and Perception checks to Seek creatures attempting to sneak up on the camp.

**Map The Area**
CONCENTRATE
As long as your group has successfully Reconnoitered the hex, you can use this activity to create an accurate map of the hex with a successful [Survival](compendium/skills.md#Survival) check (typically at a trained or expert DC). When you have an accurate map of the hex, the DC of any check to navigate that hex is reduced by 2.

##### Existing Activities
Characters can use the [Subsist](rules/actions/subsist.md) downtime activity, which follows the same rules but assumes they're using it after 8 hours or less of exploration. Any skill feats or other abilities that apply to [Subsist](rules/actions/subsist.md) normally still apply here.

In general, the various exploration activities (except [Hustle](rules/actions/hustle.md)) can be used as individual hexploration activities, as can skill actions, at the GM's discretion.

#### Random Encounters
When exploring, there is always a chance the PC will stumble upon random encounters, depending on the terrain. At the start of each day of hexploration, roll a flat check and consult the appropriate terrain type on Table 3–7: Random Encounter Chance. If the flat check is a success, the PCs have a random encounter, and on a critical success, they have two random encounters. Roll on Table 3–8: Random Encounter Type to determine the type of encounter. Once you know the type of the encounter, either choose from the list you made for that region or choose your own.

| Terrain Type | Flat Check DC* |
|--------------|----------------|
| Aquatic | 17 |
| Arctic | 17 |
| Desert | 17 |
| Forest | 14 |
| Mountain | 16 |
| Plains | 12 |
| Swamp | 14 |

* On a road or river, decrease the DC by 2. If PCs are flying, increase the DC by 3, but choose a hazard or monster that is relevant to flying PCs.

| `1d10` | Encounter |
|--------|-----------|
| 1–5 | Harmless |
| 6–7 | Hazard |

#### Switching Out of Hexploration
Most short encounters do not affect the number of hexploration activities that the PCs can perform during the day, but when the PCs take on multiple encounters or engage in activities that take hours rather than minutes, you'll want to deduct the time from their available hexploration activities. For the story's sake, it's best to think of hexploration activities as the various things that the PCs have time to do in the daylight hours. For instance, maybe the group spends 2 of their 3 hexploration activities Reconnoitering a hex, finding a tengu monastery, and learning that it is a sprawling complex underneath a small wooded hill. You might decide that the PCs found it in the evening, and they have the choice between making a foray into the complex late in the day or pursuing some individual activities, camping for the night, and starting off fresh in the morning.
