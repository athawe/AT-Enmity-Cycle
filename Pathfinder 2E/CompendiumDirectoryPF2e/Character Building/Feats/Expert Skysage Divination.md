## Feat 10
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Basic Skysage Divination
* * *
Your studies of the stars have taught you about the mysteries of the cosmos. You learn a 4th-rank spell from any spell list. At 12th level, you learn a 5th-rank spell, and at 14th level, you learn a 6th-rank spell. Each of these spells must come from the divination school. You become an expert with spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells.
