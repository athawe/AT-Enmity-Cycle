Choose one of the following options that applies to you.\n\n*   If you are in water, you gain a [[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Adapt Self (Swim)|swim Speed]] equal to half your Speed.\n*   If you are in water, you become able to breathe water.\n*   If it's too dark for you to see, you gain [[Spell Effects/Spell Effect_ Adapt Self (Darkvision)|Darkvision]].\n*   If you are in an environment of severe heat or severe cold, you are protected from the effects of severe heat or severe cold, and the spell lasts 10 minutes."
