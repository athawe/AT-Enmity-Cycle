# Effect: Glittering Snare (Failure)
## Level 4
### 






The creature takes a -2 status penalty to Stealth checks for 2 minutes or until it spends a 2-action activity, which has the manipulate trait, to remove the glitter. If the creature was [[Conditions/Invisible|Invisible]], the glitter outlines it for 1 round, making it [[Conditions/Concealed|Concealed]] rather than [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] to visual senses.
