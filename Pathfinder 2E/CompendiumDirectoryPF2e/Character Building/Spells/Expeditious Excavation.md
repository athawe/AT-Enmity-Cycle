    desc: "You remove loose dirt, dust, gravel, sand, and the like (though not solid stone) up to the size of a 5-foot cube. Any Medium or smaller creature standing atop the earth when the spell is cast must attempt a Reflex save or Acrobatics check.\n* * *\n\n**Success** The creature is unaffected and can choose to either descend the pit without damage or move to the nearest available space of its choice.\n\n**Failure** The creature falls [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]] in the nearest available space of its choice, or falls into the pit if it prefers.\n\n**Critical Failure** The creature falls into the pit excavated by the spell and lands Prone, taking falling damage as normal.\n* * *\n\n**Heightened (+2)** The spell can excavate an additional 5-foot cube of earth. If you excavate all four 5-foot cubes beneath a Large creature, it must attempt a Reflex save or Acrobatics check, as above."
