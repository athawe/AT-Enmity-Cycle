# Overwhelming Breath `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[concentrate]][[monk]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** ki spells
* * *
You control your breathing and align it with your ki, exhaling with controlled force in order to overcome your opponent's resistance.

If you use your next action to Cast a Spell that has the monk trait and no duration, the spell and any Strikes you make as a result of casting it ignore an amount of the target's resistance to physical damage equal to your level.
