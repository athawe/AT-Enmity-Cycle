# Interweave Dispel `pf2:1`
## Feat 14
### [[sorcerer]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** dispel magic in your spell repertoire
* * *
You weave dispelling energy into a spell, sending both effects at a foe.

If your next action is to cast a single-target spell against a creature, and you either hit the foe with the spell attack roll or the foe fails its saving throw, you can cast [[Spells/Dispel Magic|Dispel Magic]] on the foe as a free action, expending a spell slot as normal and targeting one spell effect affecting the foe.
