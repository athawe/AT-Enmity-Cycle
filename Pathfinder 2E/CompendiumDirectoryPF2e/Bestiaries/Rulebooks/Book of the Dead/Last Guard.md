Any creature that fails its save is also [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 3]] (or [[Conditions/Frightened 1|Frightened 4]] on a critical failure).\n\nIf the troop occupies 8 or fewer squares, this area decreases to a 30-foot cone."

The damage depends on the number of actions.\n\n`pf2:1` 1d8+2 slashing and 1d8 void damage\n\n`pf2:2` 2d8+14 slashing and 2d8 void damage\n\n`pf2:3` 3d8+14 slashing and 3d8 void damage"

  - name: "Spectral Charge"
    desc: "`pf2:3`  The last guards charge, swarming through their foes. The troop Flies up to double its Speed, dealing 4d8 void damage to each creature whose space it moves through (DC 40 Reflex check). Any creature that fails its save is also [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 1]] (or [[Conditions/Drained 1|Drained 2]] on a critical failure). The troop can affect each creature only once in a single use of Spectral Charge."

  - name: "Troop Movement"
    desc: "  Whenever the troop Strides, they first Form Up as a free action to condense into a 20-foot-by-20-foot area (minus any missing squares), then move up to their Speed. This works just like a Gargantuan creature moving."
