[[Vinn Gharban]] (NG male human inventor) needs help with getting his academy up and running 
- Anything historic that the party finds, he'll pay 110% of normal cost for it. 
- He has hopes that the ruins to the south yield some decent artifacts. 
- An artifact he brought from his travels in Rahadoum starts acting strangely (turns out its a relic that must be activated in some way to be of use)
- Wants a jumbo construct
