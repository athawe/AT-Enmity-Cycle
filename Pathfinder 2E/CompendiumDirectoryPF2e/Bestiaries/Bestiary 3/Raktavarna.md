The least of all rakshasas, raktavarnas resemble wicked serpents with glowing red eyes and oversized fangs. Often forced into service by mortal conjurers or more powerful rakshasas, raktavarnas frequently act subservient to their masters while secretly plotting to overthrow them.

Rakshasas are evil spirits who cloak themselves in the guises of humanoid creatures, that they might walk unseen among their prey. They often seek to shape and corrupt society from within.
