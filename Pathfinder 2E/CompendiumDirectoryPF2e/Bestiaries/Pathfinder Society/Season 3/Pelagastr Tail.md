  - name: "Entropy Sense (Imprecise) 30 feet"
    desc: " (divine,prediction) The pelagastr tail can anticipate the most likely location of a creature through their supernatural insight into the forces of chaotic probabilities and chance. This grants the pelagastr tail the ability to sense creatures within the listed range. A creature under the effects of [[Spells/Veil of Privacy|Veil of Privacy]] or that is otherwise shielded from divinations and predictions cannot be noticed via entropy sense."

  - name: "Out of Phase"
    desc: "  The pelagastr tail weakens as the Lodge's connection to reality is reestablished by the _Material Failsafe_. The first time the failsafe is activated, the pelagastr tail loses the Discordant Diversion reaction. The second time the failsafe is activated, it loses the Constrict ability. The third time the failsafe is activated, the pelagastr tail loses fast healing, takes 3d6 damage, and becomes [[Conditions/Slowed 1|Slowed 1]] until it leaves the Woodsedge Lodge and returns to the Maelstrom."

  - name: "[[Creature Family Ability Glossary/(Protean) Protean Anatomy|Protean Anatomy]]"
    desc: " (divine) A protean's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. Immediately after the protean takes acid, electricity, or sonic damage, it gains the listed amount of resistance to that damage type. This lasts for 1 hour or until the next time the protean takes damage of one of the other types (in which case its resistance changes to match that type), whichever comes first. The protean is immune to polymorph effects unless it is a willing target. If [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] or [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]], the protean automatically recovers at the end of its next turn as new sensory organs grow to replace the compromised ones.\n\n[[Bestiary Effects/Effect_ Protean Anatomy|Effect: Protean Anatomy]]"
