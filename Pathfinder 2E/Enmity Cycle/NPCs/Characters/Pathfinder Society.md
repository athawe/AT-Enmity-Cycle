### Zaib Ben-Ghanem
**Appearance:** Arion is still a man in the flush of youth: Short-cropped, jet black hair sets off his piercing blue eyes. His frame is only lightly muscled, but toned and trained. The weight of his office, however, has brought bags beneath his eyes. And the late hours his sense of responsibility brings often causes his shoulders to stoop with exhaustion. But when the Syr gathers his strength, the image of a great man remains.
**Quote:** “Just give me time to think. There must be a way.”
**Roleplaying**:
- A passionate man, but — increasingly — a weary one. (Looking to retire)
- In desperate need of friends, but years of experience and loss have taught him not to trust lightly.
- Rests his chin heavily into the palm of his hand.
