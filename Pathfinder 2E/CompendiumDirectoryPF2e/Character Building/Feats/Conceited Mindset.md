# Conceited Mindset
## Feat 2
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** tenets of evil

Because you know your mind is superior, you scoff at anyone who would alter your mental state-but this hubris gets the better of you when you're wrong.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against mental effects. If you succeed at a save against a mental effect, you critically succeed instead; similarly, if you fail at a save against a mental effect, you critically fail instead.
