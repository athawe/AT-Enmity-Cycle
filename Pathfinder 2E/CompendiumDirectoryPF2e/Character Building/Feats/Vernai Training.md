**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Achaekek's Grip; Advanced Red Mantis Magic
* * *
To resurrect a creature you've slain, a spellcaster must counteract your influence on its death. The DC of this check is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher.

In addition, add two 5th-rank spells to your Red Mantis assassin spellbook-both spells must be chosen from the following options:

*   [[Spells/Death Ward|Death Ward]],
*   [[Spells/Drop Dead|Drop Dead]],
*   [[Spells/False Vision|False Vision]],
*   [[Spells/Hallucination|Hallucination]],
*   [[Spells/Illusory Scene|Illusory Scene]],
*   [[Spells/Mind Probe|Mind Probe]], or
*   [[Spells/Sending|Sending]].

You gain a 5th-rank spell slot that you can use to prepare a spell from your Red Mantis assassin spellbook.
