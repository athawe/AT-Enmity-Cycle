# Detective's Readiness
## Feat 4
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




When you're on a case, you stay watchful and resolute to avoid tricks your suspect might pull.

You gain your circumstance bonus from [[Actions/Pursue a Lead|Pursue a Lead]] on saving throws (and their DCs, as normal) against the subject of a lead, and you can use [[Actions/Clue In|Clue In]] to assist an ally's saving throw against that subject.
