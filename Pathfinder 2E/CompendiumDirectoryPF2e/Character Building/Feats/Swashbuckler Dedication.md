# Swashbuckler Dedication
## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]][[multiclass]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Charisma +2; Dexterity +2

Choose a [[Class Features/Swashbuckler's Style|Swashbuckler Style]]. You gain the [[Class Features/Panache|Panache]] class feature, and you can gain panache in all the ways a swashbuckler of your style can.

You become trained in Acrobatics or the skill associated with your style. If you were already trained in both skills, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in swashbuckler class DC. You don't gain any other effects of your chosen style.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Swashbuckler|Swashbuckler]] archetype.
