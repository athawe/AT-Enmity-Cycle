# Improved Grab `pf2:0`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The monster can use [[Bestiary Ability Glossary/Grab|Grab]] as a free action triggered by a hit with its initial attack. A monster with Improved Grab still needs to spend an action to extend the duration for creatures it already has [[Conditions/Grabbed|Grabbed]].
