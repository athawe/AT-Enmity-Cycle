Deinonychuses are wily hunters that attack in groups of up to a dozen individuals, ripping apart their prey with sharp talons and powerful jaws. They are lean and muscular, and have two powerful legs and a long tail that helps them maintain balance. Although deinonychuses don't use their dexterous clawed forelimbs to attack, the dinosaurs can use them to pull aside small barriers. Although some of these dinosaurs have scaly skin, most have thatches of vibrantly colored feathers as well. A deinonychus is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 150 pounds.

However, larger deinonychuses exist. These creatures-which stand taller than a human-are called megaraptors.

Remnants from the world's primeval era, these enormous reptilian animals still exist in large numbers in isolated and remote wildernesses or far underground within magical Darklands caverns. Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other monstrous humanoids sometimes use dinosaurs as mounts, guards, or hunting animals. Humans and other ancestries have also been known to collect dinosaurs, be it to display them in menageries or keep them as exotic pets or guardians. Such activities are generally pursuits of the rich or eccentric, but certain druids and other guardians of nature feel strong kinships with dinosaurs as well and take them on as companions. When dinosaurs establish themselves in regions beyond their normal habitats, it is generally the result of these captive creatures escaping into the wild.
