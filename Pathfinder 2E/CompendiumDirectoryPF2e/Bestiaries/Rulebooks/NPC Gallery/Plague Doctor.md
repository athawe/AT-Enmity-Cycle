These healers, often seen wearing distinctive masks and burning powders to defend against airborne plagues, are as much feared as they are respected. To see a plague doctor signals that disease has infested the land-and that it might have already taken hold. Despite their devoted work in curing the untouchable, they are sometimes treated with suspicion, as if they are somehow the cause of the plague.

The world is a dangerous place. Thankfully, there are those who devote their lives to easing the pain and suffering of others.
