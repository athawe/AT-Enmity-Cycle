A monstrosity of living flame and magma, Xotani may be the weakest of Rovagug's spawn, but it remains a formidable threat. Xotani was slain in 2104 AR by an alliance of spellcasters, but recently its deathlike slumber was interrupted. Its corpse twitches, signaling that it might be close to returning.

* * *

The spawn are titanic terrors of immense size and strength that live only to destroy. Tarrasque and Xotani are but two of Rovagug's spawn. Others, including Chemnosit (the Monarch Worm), Kothogaz (the Dance of Disharmony), and Volnagur (the End-Singer) hold places of horror in the history of various regions, but the most famed is Ulunat (the Unholy First), whose beetle-like carcass remains sprawled in Sothis, the capital of Osirion.
