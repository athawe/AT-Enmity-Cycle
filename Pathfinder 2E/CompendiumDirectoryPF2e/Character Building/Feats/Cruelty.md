# Cruelty `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]][[concentrate]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** devotion spell (touch of corruption)
* * *
The harm you deal with your corrupting touch saps the strength from your enemy's body.

If your next action is to cast [[Spells/Touch of Corruption|Touch of Corruption]] on a living creature, the target is also [[Conditions/Enfeebled 1|Enfeebled 1]] for 1 minute if it fails its save (enfeebled 2 if it critically fails).
