Adversary Rosters https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/38547/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-the-key-part-4-adversary-rosters
- Establish a **marching order**. Also normal if they want various standard marching orders for certain common situations like exploration, combat, opening doors, searching, etc.
- Ask which **doors** they leave open and if they secure them or not. (They may shut on their own)
- Don't forget lighting & darkness!
- Traps don't have to trigger all of the time, instead there's a chance. OSE uses 2-in-6 each time someone walks over one.
#### Sequence of Play Per Turn
1. **Wandering monsters**: The GM makes checks as applicable.
2. **Actions**: The party decides what action to take (e.g. moving, searching, listening, entering rooms).
3. **Description**: The GM describes what happens. 
4. **End of turn**: The GM updates time records, with special attention to light sources, spell durations, and the party’s need to rest.

Add 2 traps, an extra locked door, and a stuck door.
## Random Encounters 
- Making noise or moving with a light source increases chances of wandering monsters, and makes it harder/impossible to be surprising.
- Resting somewhere appropriate and quietly decreases chances. 
- **Frequency**: A check is typically rolled once **every two turns** in the dungeon. The typical chance of encountering a wandering monster is 1-in-6.

## Time Tracker 
- Must rest for 8 hours after every 16 hours or else become fatigued. Sleeping in armour makes you fatigued and stops you from losing fatigued.

> [!NOTE]- GM Priorities
> The following points will be good to keep in mind to create a fun and smooth experience as your players go about exploring the world.
> - Evoke the setting with vivid sensory details.
> - Shift the passage of time to emphasize tension and uncertainty, and speed past uneventful intervals.
> - Get players to add details by asking for their reactions.
> - Present small-scale mysteries to intrigue players and spur investigation.
> - When rolls are needed, look for ways to move the action forward, or add interesting wrinkles on a failure.
> - Plan effective transitions to encounters.


> [!NOTE]+ Key notes on Exploration
> - If it's important to know exactly how much time is passing, you can usually estimate time spent in exploration mode to 10-minute increments.
> - It can help you to think of exploration as a series of scenes, where encounters break up exploration and function as subsections within it. Many of these are based on geography, for example, with exploring a series of dungeon corridors as one scene and entering the dungeon's great hall kicking off another. Other times, you'll break out of a scene at a point of interest. If the PCs decide to stop their travels and investigate a statue, think of that as a new scene.
> - When playing out a scene, your initial description should set the expectation of what level of detail the scene might go into, with you and the players adjusting as needed during play.
> - Daily prep scenes can be a good time to check in to see how players might think their characters are feeling.
> - When a complex hazard triggers, move to encounter mode. Simple hazards are usually dealt with in exploration mode, but that doesn't mean that they should be glossed over. **Clearly depict what action by a PC sets off the hazard and what happens as the hazard activates**, and illustrate any aftereffects. PCs have many ways to heal themselves, so keep in mind that a damaging hazard won't always have a huge effect. They tend to work best if their activation might alert creatures in the area, lock the PCs out of an area, or cause a similar narrative setback beyond just damage or another condition easily removed outside of the pressure of combat.
> - Disabling hazards should be tense. If a hazard requires multiple checks to disable, it’s good to describe what happens with each success to show incremental progress.
> - **Investigating** and searching for clues is another common exploration scene. Lead off with a definite clue that has details but clearly isn't the whole picture. Though one person starts the investigation, getting others involved can help them become more interested and bring different skills to bear to get other types of information. Reward collaboration and clever ideas.
> - if any players have invested in exploration-themed abilities for their characters, those abilities should still matter. 
> - You can usually move through a travel scene pretty quickly. For a journey that takes multiple days, you might need to have the group Subsist if they run out of food.


### XP Tips 
- In the case of XP, the guidelines are simple: If the player characters avoided the challenge through smart tactical play, a savvy diplomatic exchange, clever use of magic, or another approach that required ingenuity and planning, award them the normal XP for the encounter. If they did something that took only moderate effort or was a lucky break, like finding a secret passage and using it to avoid a fight, award them XP for a minor or moderate accomplishment. In an adventure that’s more free-form, like a sprawling dungeon with multiple paths, there might be no reward for bypassing an encounter, because doing so was trivial.
