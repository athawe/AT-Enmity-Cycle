LINGERING NOTE EMPLOYER 
**District** Port District
A large mill that focuses on the production of flour and grain. 
**Courrin Whesterwill** (NG male human miller 2; indifferent; *Perception DC 16, Will DC 16*) If the PCs earn the support of Courrin and give him no cause to suspect theyâ€™re allied with his employer, he approaches them with an offer to work at subtly undermining the Lingering Note influence in town; this allows the PCs to Earn Income by making Deception checks.
