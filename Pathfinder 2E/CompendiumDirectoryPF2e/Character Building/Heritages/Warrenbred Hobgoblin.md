# Warrenbred Hobgoblin

### 






Your ancestors lived underground. Your ears are larger than those of other hobgoblins and sensitive to echoes. When you are underground, you can use the [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] action to sense [[Conditions/Undetected|Undetected]] creatures within a 30-foot burst instead of a 15-foot burst. In addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to [[Actions/Squeeze|Squeeze]], you get a critical success instead.
