You infuse your entire being into a single shot, merging your body into the blast and enabling you to travel the same path as your bolt or bullet. Strike a creature with the required weapon. On a success, if the target was within 120 feet, you and all your gear are teleported to an open space of your choice within 10 feet of the target.
