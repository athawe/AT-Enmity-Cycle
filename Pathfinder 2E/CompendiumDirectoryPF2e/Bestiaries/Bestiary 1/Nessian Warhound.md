Believed to be bred by the Prince of Darkness himself within vast kennels in the infernal realm of Nessus, Nessian warhounds are the favored guards and hunting hounds of powerful fiends and, rarely, those mortals who worship them and have earned their favor.

* * *

Hell hounds are fiendish, extraplanar canines hailing from the pit that can hunt down quarry and breathe supernatural gouts of flame. They are temperamental and quick to aggressive behavior.
