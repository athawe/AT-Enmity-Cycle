# Effect: Rhino Shot
## Level 1
### 






On a successful Strike, the attack deals an additional 2d6 force damage, and the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude check or be knocked [[Conditions/Prone|Prone]]. If the hit with the _rhino shot_ was a critical success, the target is knocked prone unless it critically succeeds at its save.
