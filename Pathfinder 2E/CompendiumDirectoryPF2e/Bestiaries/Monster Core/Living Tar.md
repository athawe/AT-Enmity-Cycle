Most often found belowground, these oozes scour caves for objects to dissolve with their corrosive secretions. These sticky masses are often filled with bones, fossils, and discarded weaponry from adventurers.

Slimes, molds, and other oozes can be found in dank dungeons and shadowed forests. While not necessarily evil, some grow to enormous sizes and have insatiable appetites.
