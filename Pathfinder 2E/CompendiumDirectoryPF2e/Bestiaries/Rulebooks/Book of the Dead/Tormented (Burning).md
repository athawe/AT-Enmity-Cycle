Twisted caricatures of living beings, tormented arise from the remains of those who've been tortured to death. They appear as the mortals they were in life, horribly disfigured by acts of cruelty. Unable to rest, they haunt the sites of their deaths, doomed to relive their last moments of agony. The toxic psychic residue of their death is so great it spills over, afflicting anyone who meets the tormented's haunted gaze.
