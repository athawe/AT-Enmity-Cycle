## Feat 2
### [[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in light armor and simple weapons

You are always ready to draw your weapon and begin a duel, no matter the circumstances. You gain the [[Feats/Quick Draw|Quick Draw]] ranger feat, enabling you to both draw and attack with a weapon as 1 action. This serves as Quick Draw for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Duelist|Duelist]] archetype.
