A jailer's primary responsibility is to keep prisoners from escaping. Jailers must often use force, or the threat of force, to keep their charges in line, as even the most carefully crafted cells, manacles, or chains can fail with time and persistence when the prisoners have the will to attempt an escape.

Larger societies rely on those with the authority and the ability to interpret and enforce laws. In good-aligned societies, these officials carry out their duties fairly. In neutral and evil ones, these officials can be harsh and cruel (with an altered alignment to reflect this), imposing severe punishments on those who can't pay for mercy.
