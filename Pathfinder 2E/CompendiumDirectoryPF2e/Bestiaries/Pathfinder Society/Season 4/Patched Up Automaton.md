    desc: "  When a crumbling automaton hits a creature with their barbed net, the net wraps around the target, which becomes [[Conditions/Clumsy 1|Clumsy 1]] and takes a -10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds. If the Strike was a critical success, the target is also [[Conditions/Immobilized|Immobilized]]. When a creature Escapes (DC 20), or if the Strike misses, the net crumbles into nothing. Each time a creature attempts to [[Actions/Escape|Escape]], it takes 1d8 slashing damage from the net's barbs, regardless of whether the attempt succeeds."
