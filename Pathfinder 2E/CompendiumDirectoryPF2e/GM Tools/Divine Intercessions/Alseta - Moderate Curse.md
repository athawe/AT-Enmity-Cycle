# Alseta - Moderate Curse

### 






**Moderate Curse:** Crossing thresholds becomes daunting. Whenever you move through a portal, gateway, or door, you gain the [[Conditions/Sickened 1|Sickened 2]] condition. Magical travel is even more exhausting; after traveling via teleportation, plane shift, or the like, you also gain the [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] condition until you get a full night's rest.
