# Effect: Architect's Pattern Book
## Level 6
### 






If your next action is to cast a [[Spells/Cozy Cabin|Cozy Cabin]], [[Spells/Planar Palace|Planar Palace]], or [[Spells/Resplendent Mansion|Resplendent Mansion]] spell, you add a room to the structure that is up to 10 feet per side per rank of the spell. This room is outfitted with all the accoutrements for a particular type of recreation, determined by you when you cast the spell. Any character who spends at least 1 hour using this recreational facility and then sleeps a full 8 hours inside the location created by the spell is exceptionally well-rested. They regain double the amount of Hit Points they would normally receive for an 8-hour rest, and when they make the next day's preparations, they gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks and Will saves for the next 12 hours.
