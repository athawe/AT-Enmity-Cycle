## Feat 18
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mercy
* * *
Your mercy transcends the bounds of life and death.

When you use [[Feats/Mercy|Mercy]], you can cast [[Spells/Lay on Hands|Lay on Hands]] on a creature that died since your last turn to return it to life. The target returns to life with 1 hit point and becomes wounded 1. You can't use Ultimate Mercy if the triggering effect was disintegrate or a death effect.
