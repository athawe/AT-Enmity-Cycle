Fungus leshys guard caves, bogs, and damp, dark places. Their fungus gardens are bizarre by most standards, but fungus leshys are extremely proud of their works.

Leshys are intelligent plant creatures that guard areas of primeval wilderness or earthly power. Originally created by powerful fey, they manifest when a skilled practitioner of primal magic-typically a druid-combines a nature spirit with a body carefully grown from local vegetation. The rites and materials required to create a leshy vary depending on the type of leshy. They are typically given life in an area of great natural significance, such as an arboreal's grove, a druidic circle, a fairy ring, or a great natural wonder.
