# Stance: Stumbling Stance

### 






Granted by [[Feats/Stumbling Stance|Stumbling Stance]]

You enter a seemingly unfocused stance that mimics the movements of the inebriated—bobbing, weaving, leaving false openings, and distracting your enemies from your true movements. While in this stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]].

The only Strikes you can make are stumbling swing unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. If an enemy hits you with a melee Strike while in this stance, it becomes off-guard against the next stumbling swing Strike you make against it before the end of your next turn.
