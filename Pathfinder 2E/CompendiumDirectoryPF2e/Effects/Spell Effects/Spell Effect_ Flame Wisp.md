# Spell Effect: Flame Wisp
## Level 2
### 






Three faintly glowing wisps of fire float around your head. Each time you hit a creature with a Strike, one of the wisps goes hurtling towards that creature, dealing 1d4 fire damage. If you Cast a Spell with the fire trait while you have fewer than three wisps, a new wisp appears.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d4.
