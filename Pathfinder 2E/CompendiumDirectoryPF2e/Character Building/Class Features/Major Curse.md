# Major Curse
## Feat 11
### [[oracle]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You've learned to better balance the conflicting powers wreaking havoc on your body. Immediately after completing the casting of a revelation spell while you are affected by your moderate curse, your curse progresses to its major effect, rather than overwhelming you. This effect lasts until you [[Actions/Refocus|Refocus]], which reduces your curse to its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of your major curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse.

In addition, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool from 2 to 3. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.
