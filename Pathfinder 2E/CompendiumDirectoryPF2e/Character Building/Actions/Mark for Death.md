# Mark for Death `pf2:3`

### 

**Category** offensive; 




**Requirements** You can see and hear the creature you intend to mark

* * *

**Effect** You designate a single creature as your mark. This lasts until the mark dies or you use Mark for Death again. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Actions/Seek|Seek]] your mark and on Deception checks to [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] against your mark.

Your agile and finesse weapons and unarmed attacks gain the backstabber and deadly d6 weapon traits when you're attacking your mark.

If the weapon or unarmed attack already has the deadly trait, increase the size of the deadly damage die by one step instead of giving it deadly d6.
